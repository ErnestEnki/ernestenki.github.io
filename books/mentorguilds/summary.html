          <h1>The Problem</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Technology and society evolve faster than education can keep up, leaving graduates unprepared for real-world demands. Traditional institutions—funded upfront through tuition or taxes—have no stake in long-term graduates' outcomes, creating a gap between what people learn and what they need to survive,
              let alone
              thrive. Despite good
              intentions, reforms are slowed by bureaucracy, politics, and resistance to change. Even with unlimited funding, education would still fail to align with market and life realities unless educators share incentives with their students.</p>

          </div>

        <article>
          <h1>MentorGuilds: The Solution</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds are our proposed new kind of legal organization built to align the incentives of educators and students. Its core features are:</p>

            <ol>
              <li><b>Funding Model:</b> They earn income only from their mentees—primarily through a small share of future earnings, paid only for set number hours worked in jobs that use the skills the MentorGuild helped provide, and
                optionally through tuition. There is no debt, interest, fees, or penalties, and mentees owe nothing if they earn nothing or change professions.
                When mentees succeed, MentorGuilds succeed. When mentees struggle, both share the loss. This shared fate ensures accountability, long-term support for <b>work and life</b>, and a focus on real-world results.</li>
              <li><b>Open Data:</b> Every mentee’s contract, work hours, and income record are published as open data (<a href="contracts" target="contracts">example</a>), making MentorGuilds the most <b>transparent</b> institutions in society. This empowers individuals to choose thriving and compatible MentorGuilds;
                helps governments, companies and society make smarter decisions; exposes abuse; and rewards organizations that deliver genuine, measurable value.</li>
              <li><b>Freedom:</b> MentorGuilds can take many forms—non-profit or for-profit, local or global, small or large, digital or in-person. They can specialize in niche trades or emerging fields, target specific groups or serve everyone, and design flexible or structured programs. Their greatest strength lies
                in this <b>freedom to quickly adapt</b>—to changing industries, economies, and the evolving needs of each mentee over time.</li>
            </ol>


            <p>MentorGuilds may resemble <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_share_agreement" target="_blank">Income Sharing Agreements (ISAs)</a> or <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/dtc-finance-toolkit-factsheets/income-contingent-loans-icls" target="_blank">Income Contingent Loans (ICLs)</a>, but they
              operate on a very different foundation. ISAs and ICLs simply finance traditional education through short-term contracts, often repaid regardless of how relevant the job is. MentorGuilds, by contrast, create long-term partnerships that combine work and life education, with repayment only from jobs that use
              the skills they helped provide. They retain responsibility for outcomes, foster community, and curate the best mix of educational sources—turning a financial transaction into an ongoing relationship built on shared success.</p>

        <article>
          <h1>Profits</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Preliminary estimates suggest that MentorGuilds could be both profitable and sustainable. A contribution of about five percent of a mentee’s income over 9,200 relevant work hours—roughly five years of full-time work—could generate returns similar to those of vocational schools or technology bootcamps.
              Their structure offers major efficiencies: mentoring takes less time than teaching since external courses deliver most of the instruction; operations can run fully online without costly physical infrastructure; and shared tools, platforms, and AI-powered knowledge bases create economies of scale. In
              addition,
              MentorGuilds cultivate a strong peer community where mentees support one another, boosting learning outcomes, community spirit and long-term engagement.</p>

            <p>These advantages make many forms of MentorGuilds viable. However, to make the system fairer, more scalable, and more efficient—allowing even previously low-margin models to thrive— these policy measures are strongly recommended:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Tax exemption:</b> This would prevent double taxation, promote education and new economic data as a national priority, and offset the strict transparency and operational limits MentorGuilds must follow.</li>
              <li><b>Mentors as legal partners:</b> Recognizing mentors as partners would align incentives and reflect their role as part-time professionals who remain active in their industries. These mentors would operate independently, share in repayments rather than receive fixed salaries, and avoid traditional
                employment costs.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Combined with low overhead and strong outcome-based incentives, these measures could make MentorGuilds both financially sustainable and socially transformative—driving progress in education, innovation, and mobility.</p>

          <h1>The Power of Aligned Incentives for Work and Life</h1>
          <div>

            <p>
              MentorGuilds are designed to deliver high-quality education and personalized support, tailored to the specific needs and abilities of each mentee. Their goal is not only to provide better education than traditional systems but also to offer <b>continuous and real-world guidance</b> that connects both
              <b>work and life</b>.
              In a fast-changing world, where professional and personal challenges often overlap, this holistic approach is essential. Over time, it has the potential to transform not only individual lives but entire societies.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Work:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>Helping mentees find job opportunities that match their skills, aspirations, and personal constraints (such as location, caregiving duties, or preferred industries).</li>
                  <li>Guiding mentees through workplace dynamics—dealing with difficult colleagues, understanding office politics, and learning when to speak up or seek allies.</li>
                  <li>Assisting with salary, promotion, and contract negotiations, especially for those unfamiliar with professional norms in their industry or region.</li>
                  <li>Advising mentees on the best location where their profession is in demand, and taxes are favorable.</li>
                  <li>Encouraging the ongoing development of technical and interpersonal skills to stay competitive in a market reshaped by AI, automation, and global change.</li>
                  <li>Protecting mentees from exploitative practices such as unpaid work, long shifts, unrealistic promises, coercive NDAs, or illegal job conditions.</li>
                  <li>Promoting smart career moves—like industry changes, upskilling, or strategic lateral roles that build long-term value.</li>
                  <li>Encourage mentees to start their own businesses, secure funding, attract customers, and expand their ventures.</li>
                  <li>Offer financial aid to those who need it, enabling mentees to focus on study or work.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li><b>Life:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Mental health:</b> Teaching coping strategies, helping mentees spot early signs of burnout, and connecting them with professional help when needed.</li>
                  <li><b>Physical health:</b> Promoting healthy routines for sleep, posture, diet, and exercise—especially for those in high-stress or sedentary jobs.</li>
                  <li><b>Relationships:</b> Helping mentees build and maintain respectful friendships, partnerships, and professional networks—both online and offline.</li>
                  <li><b>Work-life balance:</b> Supporting thoughtful tradeoffs (like income versus flexibility), managing conflicting priorities, and establishing clear boundaries.</li>
                  <li><b>Financial literacy:</b> Teaching mentees how to budget, invest, compare job offers beyond salary (such as benefits or equity), understand taxes, and avoid scams or debt traps.</li>
                  <li><b>Major life transitions:</b> Offering guidance through big changes such as moving cities, switching careers, starting a family, or facing health challenges.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The reason for this broad range of support is simple: anything that harms a mentee’s work quality or productivity will also harm the MentorGuild’s income and reputation—especially under the open data requirement. That is why successful MentorGuilds will adopt a holistic approach to their mentees’
              well-being, offering guidance and resources that extend far beyond traditional job training. In essence, the most effective MentorGuilds will teach not only work skills, but life skills.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds are organizations designed to align the interests of learners and educators. Their mission is to equip people with the skills to thrive—not only in their careers but throughout life. Free from rigid curricula, bureaucracy, and outdated traditions, they act as launchpads for innovation,
              driven by rapid feedback loops that adapt to each mentee’s needs and a constantly changing world. Education becomes not a one-time event, but a continuous partnership for growth.</p>

            <p>Rather than a centrally managed system, MentorGuilds operate as a framework of aligned incentives—rewarding real outcomes and encouraging lifelong learning. Through aligned incentives, flexibility, transparency, and accountability, they aim to close the widening gap between what people can do and what the modern world
              demands.</p>
