          <h1>Intro</h1>
          <div>
            <p>The lack of quality Education traps struggling populations, locking them out of good jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities. It creates a vicious circle where families without access to proper Education cannot provide it to their children, deepening inequality with each generation.</p>
            <p>As technology and society race ahead, the traditional Education system crawls behind. The result is a widening gap between what the world demands and what graduates can actually do.</p>

          <h1>Key Concept: Education</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Many define Education as the simple acquisition of knowledge. But knowledge alone is far from enough to survive—let alone thrive—in work or in life.
            </p>

            <p>Education, in its ideal state, is the process by which individuals or entities (like groups, companies, governments, society) acquire <b>knowledge, skills, social capital, and meta-Education</b>; with the purpose to not only survive but thrive in the marketplace or life in general.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Knowledge:</b> the theoretical understanding of various subjects including foundational concepts, technologies, tools, methodologies, best practices, mental models, historical context, customers, regulations, traditions, and trends.</li>
              <li><b>Skills:</b> the practical application of knowledge to perform tasks efficiently and quickly. This is knowledge put into action. Skills include both those specific to one’s field and general abilities such as matching the right knowledge to a real-world problem, digital literacy, negotiation, time
                management, prioritizing, decision making, and problem-solving.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The next two areas also involve knowledge and skills in large parts, but they are important enough to deserve their own categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Social capital:</b> the web of relationships and skills that build trust and reputation—both among peers and with strangers. It is essential for creating strong networks and navigating social environments effectively. Social capital can be grouped into three key areas:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Self:</b> Skills applied to oneself, including active listening, effective communication, reading nonverbal cues, public speaking, offering help without being exploited, cultural sensitivity, social etiquette, conversation skills, conflict resolution, recognizing psychological issues in oneself
                    and others, political awareness, self-branding and marketing, and knowing how to build, maintain, and leverage contacts.</li>
                  <li><b>Indirect contacts:</b>following and learning from experts and thought leaders through social media, books, videos, podcasts, workshops, and conventions—while also understanding their strengths and limitations.</li>
                  <li><b>Direct contacts:</b> relationships with others in the field, from junior colleagues to senior professionals, as well as with clients, employers, stakeholders, mentors, and influential specialists. These connections allow for the exchange of advice, knowledge, and support, fostering mutual
                    growth and opportunity.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b>Meta-Education:</b> The art of learning. It covers effective learning techniques, staying motivated for continuous learning, and distinguishing between good and bad Education. It also includes developing self-awareness (knowing your own strengths and weaknesses), self-care, emotional intelligence,
                adaptability, critical thinking, and creativity.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h1>The Core Flaws of Traditional Education System</h1>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Trampled Students:</b> The system marches forward even when some fall behind, leaving lasting psychological scars.</li>
              <li><b>Missing Essentials:</b> Many critical skills are missing, leaving graduates unprepared for work and life.</li>
              <li><b>Wasteful:</b> Courses are cluttered with outdated content and methods, kept alive by tradition or decisions by committee rather than relevance.</li>
              <li><b>Misleading Prospects:</b> Students are often misled about salaries, career paths and job realities.</li>
              <li><b>Untimely:</b> Even valuable lessons arrive too early or too late—like teaching management to those who have never held a job.</li>
              <li><b>Inadequate Assessment:</b> Tests and grades rarely reflect the skills needed in real life or the job market.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Other problems—such as high tuition fees and student debt—are symptoms of these deeper flaws. Wasteful programs and false promises make inflated prices easier to justify, while curriculums that omit essential skills lead to poor job prospects, leaving graduates unable to repay the cost of their education.</p>

            <p>These issues affect both private institutions, funded directly through tuition, and public institutions, funded indirectly through taxpayers.</p>

          </div>

        <article>
          <h1>The Root Cause: Misaligned Incentives</h1>
          <div>
            <p>When graduates struggle, educators face no penalty. When they succeed—even becoming billionaires—educators gain nothing. With no stake in their students’ long-term outcomes, institutions lack the motivation to deliver Education that truly works. They have no skin in the game. </p>
            <p>The root cause of the problem is misaligned incentives.</p>

          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>A Better Model: MentorGuilds</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds are a new kind of organization designed to fix education’s broken incentives. This is not another reform—it is a decentralized way to solve Education. MentorGuilds align the success of the educator with the success of the learner.</p>

            <p>Unlike traditional institutions, MentorGuilds earn most of their income not from tuition, but from a share of their mentees’ future earnings—paid only for hours worked in jobs that use the skills the MentorGuild helped provide.</p>

            <p>When mentees succeed, MentorGuilds prosper. When mentees fail, both lose. This shared fate and long term relationships keep MentorGuilds accountable to real-world results, not empty promises or outdated practices.</p>

            <p>Most importantly, mentees never owe money unless they earn it. If they never find a job, or choose to leave the field they trained for, they owe nothing. This gives MentorGuilds a strong incentive to assess whether potential mentees are truly suited for their chosen industry—and to ensure they can remain happy and productive there for the long term.</p>
          </div>
        </article>


        <article>
          <h1>Hours, Not Years</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Repayment is tied to hours worked, not to fixed time limits. A mentee may fulfill their commitment quickly or over a lifetime. This structure gives MentorGuilds a strong incentive to protect their mentees from burnout, unpaid work, or toxic workplaces that shorten careers.</p>
            <p>MentorGuilds are motivated to promote balance—encouraging rest, further study, and even sabbaticals that reignite passion and performance. Their goal is simple: ensure mentees work at their best, not just work the most. </p>
            <p>This approach transforms Education from a one-time transaction into a lifelong partnership for growth and sustainability.</p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>Influence Without Authority</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds cannot control their mentees’ personal or professional choices. They can only advise and hope their guidance is respected. Their influence depends entirely on trust and earned respect—on soft power, not control.</p>
            <p>MentorGuilds are free to experiment. They can use different methods, technologies, and rhythms of learning. </p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>MentorGuild Roles for Mentees</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Over time, MentorGuilds may adopt multiple roles to better serve their mentees—even roles that extend beyond work related Education.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Teacher:</b> Deliver skills directly.</li>
              <li><b>Mentor:</b> Fund external courses while providing more general guidance and support focused on making mentees independent.</li>

              <li><b>Stock Market and Private Safety Net:</b> Allowing mentees to raise funds for Education or personal needs in exchange for a share of future income. This helps them navigate early challenges or unexpected setbacks.</li>
              <li><b>Student Loan Alternative:</b> Offer Education without the burden of mandatory repayments.</li>
              <li><b>Second Family:</b> Create a lasting support network that extends beyond work.</li>
              <li><b>Science and Industry Evangelist:</b> Spread discoveries and best practices that improve both productivity and well-being.</li>
              <li><b>Wellness Coach:</b> Encourage recovery, rest, and balance.</li>
              <li><b>Therapist:</b> Help mentees overcome personal struggles that limit growth.</li>
              <li><b>Life Coach:</b> Foster healthy relationships and prevent emotional setbacks from derailing careers.</li>
              <li><b>Financial Advisor:</b> Teach saving, investing, and spending habits that build stability.</li>
              <li><b>Librarian:</b> Keep knowledge organized, current, and accessible.</li>
              <li><b>Drill Sergeant:</b> Instill discipline and mastery of fundamentals.</li>
              <li><b>Social Worker:</b> Support mentees through difficult life events.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>MentorGuild Roles for Society</h1>
          <div>
            <p>By helping individuals thrive, MentorGuilds also serve the greater good.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Launchpads for Educational Innovation:</b> Their freedom to experiment will create new forms of Education.</li>
              <li><b>Economic Bridge Between Social Classes:</b> Successful professionals will have incentives to mentor the underprivileged, spreading opportunity where it is needed most.</li>
              <li><b>Healing Multi-Generational Habits and Traumas:</b> By addressing trauma and self-sabotage, MentorGuilds can break negative cycles that echo through families and communities.</li>
              <li><b>Solving Localized Problems:</b> They can specialize—training tradespeople in underserved areas or helping ex-convicts reintegrate into society.</li>
              <li><b>Basic research:</b> Over time, MentorGuilds may sponsor basic research to gain a competitive edge.</li>
              <li><b>Refugees and Local Mentors:</b> Local mentors can guide newcomers through laws, culture and job markets.</li>
              <li><b>Mentoring Nations One Mentees at the Time:</b> International MentorGuilds can raise living standards one mentee at a time, creating connections, building empathy and reducing conflict.</li>
              <li><b>Simple Guidance for Complex / Changing Markets:</b> They can help society make sense of a chaotic job market by showing which skills and careers are rising, stable, or fading.</li>
              <li><b>Empowering Individuals in a Collectivist Corporate World:</b> In a corporate world tilted toward organizations with an abundance of advisors, MentorGuilds can help individuals negotiate and protect themselves.</li>
              <li><b>Spotting Near Enemies and Guiding Better Life Choices:</b> They can teach mentees to recognize and avoid exploitative marketing and wasteful consumption.</li>
              <li><b>Intergenerational Connector:</b> Older mentors can find renewed purpose while supporting younger mentees, fostering empathy and balance across age groups.</li>
              <li><b>Flighting Regulatory Capture:</b> MentorGuilds could be incentivized to dismantle regulatory capture of industries or regions, as this could provide more opportunities for their mentees.</li>
              <li><b>Incentives for Innovation in a Patentless Economy:</b> Without patents, MentorGuilds would still promote invention—rewarding results through shared success rather than monopolies.</li>
            </ul>

          <h1>Fundamentally Different from ISAs</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds may look similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_share_agreement" target="_blank">Income Sharing Agreements (ISAs)</a> at first glance—they both involve sharing a portion of future income—but the resemblance ends there. The two are built on completely different foundations.
            </p>

            <table>
              <tr>
                <th>Income Sharing Agreements</th>
                <th>MentorGuilds</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Based on years, creating <b>short-term</b> incentives—to maximize income during that period, even at the expense of long-term health or stability.</td>
                <td>Based on hours worked, creating <b>long-term</b> incentives—to rest when needed, protect mental and physical well-being, and build lasting prosperity.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Provide access to Education only <b>before</b> a career begins.</td>
                <td>Provide Education <b>before and throughout</b> a career.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Offer financial access to Education only.</td>
                <td>Offer Education and comprehensive support, including:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Roles such as talent agent, workers’ advocate, guild, or wellness coach.</li>
                    <li>Direct financial assistance when needed.</li>
                    <li>Ongoing advice through a career.</li>
                  </ul>
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Contractual and transactional</td>
                <td>Community-driven and long-term relationships</td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>In essence, ISAs are a way to finance traditional Education. MentorGuilds are a way to build a long-term partnership for career and personal growth.</p>

          <h1>MentorGuilds Risks</h1>
          <div>
            <p>While MentorGuilds offer major benefits to both mentees and society, they also carry real risks, for example: a MentorGuild could slip into a form of indentured servitude. It could try to micromanage its mentees’ lives. Or mentees could become overly dependent on their MentorGuilds for advice and
              support.</p>
            <p>To prevent such outcomes, we introduce strong framework of checks and balances is essential. Mentees have clear and powerful rights and protections, while MentorGuilds face strict limits and firm penalties for misconduct.</p>
          </div>
        </article>


        <article>
          <h1>The Power of Open Data</h1>
          <div>
            <p>One of the most powerful features of MentorGuilds is their <b>open data requirement</b>. It will provide strong safeguards for mentees, and many benefits for society.</p>
            <p>Every mentee’s complete contract and work/income will forever be publicly available online, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The full contract terms, with repayment percentage and total work hours, and any financial aid or tuition paid.</li>
              <li>The skills delivered</li>
              <li>Ongoing monthly updates of income and work hours</li>
              <li>Mentee commentaries on their experience.</li>
              <li>Mentee identification is redacted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This level of transparency will give journalists, researchers, potential mentees, governments, investors, entrepreneurs, competitors, and industry participants and the general population a clear view of which skills, industries, and MentorGuilds are thriving and which are falling behind. It will send strong signals that drive smarter, more efficient economic
              choices.</p>
            <p>It will also make abuse hard to hide. Exploitative workloads or suspiciously inflated incomes will stand out in plain sight.</p>
            <p>Transparency will make society smarter, fairer, and more efficient.</p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds are organizations built on sound incentives. Their mission is to help people develop the skills they need to thrive—both at work and in life. They are not rigid, centrally planned systems tied to fixed teaching methods. They are launchpads for educational innovation, designed to grow and adapt alongside their mentees and a changing world.</p>

            <p>It can be hard to picture how such a new kind of institution might function. The following section offers optional reading—hypothetical examples that show how the MentorGuild model could work in practice.</p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article class="optional">
          <h1>First-Generation MentorGuilds: Low-Hanging Fruits</h1>
          <div>
            <p>In the early stages, the first generation of MentorGuilds are likely to focus on simple, high-certainty opportunities—what might be called low-hanging fruit. These are individuals who already show promise: they are talented, disciplined, and may have taken early steps toward a career but remain blocked
              due to lack of guidance or difficult life circumstances.</p>
            <p>Karla and Jane are senior software developers with decades of experience. Their talks are available online, and their blog posts are widely read. They have heard about the rise of MentorGuilds—an idea gaining traction—but notice that most existing ones are gender-neutral and miss a chance to focus on
              underrepresented groups.</p>
            <p>Having long encouraged young women to explore software development, Karla and Jane decide to take that mission further by launching their own MentorGuild: their brand new <b>“Girls Who Code MentorGuild”</b>.</p>
            <p>They begin by offering a free coding workshop / recruiting session in a low-income neighborhood, specifically for young women. To qualify, attendees must first watch three of their one-hour online videos covering the basics. This small requirement helps filter for commitment while ensuring all
              participants arrive with a shared foundation.</p>
            <p>This simple initiative marks the beginning of their MentorGuild journey—targeting a group with untapped potential and high payoff, both socially and economically.</p>
            <p>Many attendees show up for their workshop, but it quickly becomes clear—through their questions and comments—that most have not completed the required pre-course videos. One young woman stands out: <b>Bea</b>. She asks thoughtful, relevant questions that reveal she did the preparation and is eager to
              learn, even without prior experience in coding.</p>
            <p>Bea is the oldest of two sisters. Her father left the family when she was young, and her mother has held the family together ever since, running a small food stall in the local market. The family lives in a cramped apartment, surviving on a modest income.</p>
            <p>Now that Bea has finished high school, her mother is hoping she will join the food stall business and help it grow. Bea, however, is more interested in technology and software. She understands that the IT industry offers higher earning potential and long-term career opportunities, but her family cannot
              afford university or specialized training.</p>
            <p>Karla and Jane offer to take Bea on as their first official mentee. Bea is excited—but hesitant, as MentorGuilds are a new thing. She explains she needs to talk with her mother before making a decision.</p>
            <p>The next day, Bea returns with bad news: her mother needs her help at the food stall immediately. She cannot afford to spend a long time without contributing income to the family.</p>
            <p>Karla and Jane ask if they can speak directly with her mother at their home. A few days later, the four of them sit down together. Karla and Jane explain Bea’s potential. They believe that with her curiosity, work ethic, and intelligence, she could land an entry-level developer job with as little as one
              year of focused study. But Bea’s mother insists that they do not have a year—she needs her daughter’s help now.</p>
            <p>Karla asks how much income Bea would likely generate at the food stall in the coming year. The amount is modest—far less than a junior developer’s starting salary. Karla and Jane step aside and discuss whether their planned one-year education program could be compressed. They decide that with an
              intensive focus, they can give Bea the minimum essentials in three months—just enough to help her secure her first coding job. The rest of her education can be delivered later.</p>
            <p>Bea is thrilled. Her mother remains cautious. She is skeptical of MentorGuilds and unsure that such short period of education can lead to real employment.</p>
            <p>Jane addresses her concerns directly. Even in the worst-case scenario, she explains, Bea will gain valuable digital skills—skills that can be used in the family business, from creating a website to designing banners or managing inventory software. If Bea doesn’t get a job in the industry, and ends up
              working at the stall anyway, she owes nothing to
            <p>Over the following weeks, Bea works hard on learning programming, but also many other subjects.</p>
            <p>She learns how to work with a mentor—how to use their time wisely, how to ask for feedback, when to take initiative, and how to stretch herself between sessions. Karla and Jane introduce her to real-world job positions and walk through their job descriptions line by line, explaining what each requirement
              means and what level of skill she needs to reach.</p>
            <p>A few weeks before the three-month mark, they encourage Bea to start applying for jobs, even if she feels unprepared. It is not just about landing a role—it is about learning important skills such as interviewing, self-presentation, and handling rejection. Bea admits she feels unqualified. Karla and Jane
              explain the concept of impostor syndrome, reassuring her that confidence grows through action. They help her craft a solid résumé, conduct mock interviews, and debrief after each real interview to capture lessons learned.</p>
            <p>Just before the three-month deadline, Bea receives a job offer from a small startup—just the founder and a few employees. The salary matches what she would have made working full-time at her mother’s food stall, but with far more growth potential. The founder even hints at future promotions as the
              company expands.</p>
            <p>During the final interview, the founder asks if Bea is affiliated with a MentorGuild. As coached by her mentors, she says no. While this may seem ethically murky, it is fully supported by MentorGuild law, to protect mentees from the social skepticism toward unconventional educational paths—a reality
              Karla and Jane prepared her for.</p>
            <p>Bea shares the offer and job contract with her mentors for review. After discussions, they all agree: this is a strong first step. Bea accepts the position.</p>
            <p>Bea begins her new job with enthusiasm—and quickly thrives. Both she and her mother are thrilled. Bea is contributing to the family finances while working in a field she is passionate about. She is paid to learn (<b>experiential Education</b>), grow, and explore a career with long-term potential.</p>
            <p>She throws herself into the job, practicing technical skills, observing how IT companies function, and absorbing everything from data security to project management. She builds social capital with her colleagues, volunteers for extra tasks, and pays close attention to workflows and team dynamics.</p>
            <p>She also works long hours—not out of obligation, but because she is learning and engaged. Most days, she checks in with her mentors to discuss what she is learning, explore new resources, and identify areas to improve. They assign additional homework to strengthen her foundation and keep pushing her
              development forward.</p>
            <p>Her manager notices her. Impressed with Bea’s initiative and reliability, he assigns her more responsibilities. As her value to the company increases, so does her confidence—and her mother’s. The decision to join a MentorGuild appears to be paying off. The income is steady, her employer is supportive,
              and her education (both formal from the MentorGuild-provided courses, and experiential from the job) continues.</p>
            <p>With guidance from the MentorGuild, Bea regularly updates her online portfolio and public profile. As a result, headhunters begin to notice. She starts receiving inquiries and job offers. For the first time, her family’s financial future feels not only stable but hopeful.</p>
            <p>But after six months, a new pattern emerges. Bea is now spending more of her time on repetitive, low-growth tasks, often during unpaid overtime. Her manager assigns her these tasks because he trusts her—and because she delivers. But the learning curve is flattening.</p>
            <p>Bea remains upbeat. She tells her mentors she is still excited about the job. She feels valued, respected, and secure. Financially, she is doing better than she ever imagined at this point in her life.</p>
            <p>But the MentorGuild sees early warning signs.</p>
            <p>First, Bea’s unpaid overtime is being deducted from her contractual worked hours—without generating any corresponding income. This reduces the MentorGuild’s income and public profile while offering limited benefits to Bea. Second, her experiential education has begun to plateau. The daily challenges that
              once pushed her to grow have faded, replaced by routine and predictability. Her boss says he is sorry and promises to give her tasks more aligned with her talent, but nothing changes.</p>
            <p>While Bea still feels satisfied and valued, the MentorGuild gently suggests that she consider aiming higher. Her current role may feel safe and familiar, but it no longer stretches her abilities or develops new skills. What was once a perfect fit may now be holding her back.</p>
            <p>The MentorGuild’s role is not to pressure but to guide. Their concern is not just about lost income—it is about potential left untapped. The question now is whether Bea will remain in her job or seek her next stage of growth.</p>
