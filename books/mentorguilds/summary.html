          <h1>Intro</h1>
          <div>
            <p>The lack of quality Education traps struggling populations, locking them out of good jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities. It creates a vicious circle where families without access to proper Education cannot provide it to their children, deepening inequality with each generation.</p>
            <p>As technology and society race ahead, the traditional Education system crawls behind. The result is a widening gap between what the world demands and what graduates can actually do.</p>

          <h1>Key Concept: Education</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Many define Education as the simple acquisition of knowledge. But knowledge alone is far from enough to survive—let alone thrive—in work or in life.
            </p>

            <p>Education, in its ideal state, is the process by which individuals or entities (like groups, companies, governments, society) acquire <b>knowledge, skills, social capital, and meta-Education</b>; with the purpose to not only survive but thrive in the marketplace or life in general.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Knowledge:</b> the theoretical understanding of various subjects including foundational concepts, technologies, tools, methodologies, best practices, mental models, historical context, customers, regulations, traditions, and trends.</li>
              <li><b>Skills:</b> the practical application of knowledge to perform tasks efficiently and quickly. This is knowledge put into action. Skills include both those specific to one’s field and general abilities such as matching the right knowledge to a real-world problem, digital literacy, negotiation, time
                management, prioritizing, decision making, and problem-solving.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The next two areas also involve knowledge and skills in large parts, but they are important enough to deserve their own categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Social capital:</b> the web of relationships and skills that build trust and reputation—both among peers and with strangers. It is essential for creating strong networks and navigating social environments effectively. Social capital can be grouped into three key areas:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Self:</b> Skills applied to oneself, including active listening, effective communication, reading nonverbal cues, public speaking, offering help without being exploited, cultural sensitivity, social etiquette, conversation skills, conflict resolution, recognizing psychological issues in oneself
                    and others, political awareness, self-branding and marketing, and knowing how to build, maintain, and leverage contacts.</li>
                  <li><b>Indirect contacts:</b>following and learning from experts and thought leaders through social media, books, videos, podcasts, workshops, and conventions—while also understanding their strengths and limitations.</li>
                  <li><b>Direct contacts:</b> relationships with others in the field, from junior colleagues to senior professionals, as well as with clients, employers, stakeholders, mentors, and influential specialists. These connections allow for the exchange of advice, knowledge, and support, fostering mutual
                    growth and opportunity.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b>Meta-Education:</b> The art of learning. It covers effective learning techniques, staying motivated for continuous learning, and distinguishing between good and bad Education. It also includes developing self-awareness (knowing your own strengths and weaknesses), self-care, emotional intelligence,
                adaptability, critical thinking, and creativity.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>The Core Flaws of Traditional Education System</h1>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Trampled Students:</b> The system marches forward even when some fall behind, leaving lasting psychological scars.</li>
              <li><b>Missing Essentials:</b> Many critical skills are missing, leaving graduates unprepared for work and life.</li>
              <li><b>Wasteful:</b> Courses are cluttered with outdated content and methods, kept alive by tradition or decisions by committee rather than relevance.</li>
              <li><b>Misleading Prospects:</b> Students are often misled about salaries, career paths and job realities.</li>
              <li><b>Untimely:</b> Even valuable lessons arrive too early or too late—like teaching management to those who have never held a job.</li>
              <li><b>Inadequate Assessment:</b> Tests and grades rarely reflect the skills needed in real life or the job market.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Other problems do exist, such as high tuition fees and student debt, but these are symptoms of these deeper flaws, for example wasteful programs and false promises make inflated prices easier to justify.</p>

          </div>

        <article>
          <h1>The Root Cause: Misaligned Incentives</h1>
          <div>
            <p>When graduates struggle, educators face no penalty. When they succeed—even becoming billionaires—educators gain nothing. With no stake in their students’ long-term outcomes, institutions lack the motivation to deliver Education that truly works. They have no skin in the game. </p>
            <p>The root cause of the problem is misaligned incentives.</p>

          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>A Better Model: MentorGuilds</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds are our proposed new kind of organization created to fix these broken incentives. Their income does not come largely from tuition, but from a share of their mentees’ future earnings—earned only from hours worked in jobs that use the skills the MentorGuild helped provide. </p>
            <p>When mentees succeed, MentorGuilds prosper. When mentees fail, both lose. This alignment keeps MentorGuilds deeply invested in real-world results, not empty promises.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, mentees never owe money unless they earn it. If they never find a job, or choose to leave the industry they trained for, they owe nothing.</p>
          </div>
        </article>


        <article>
          <h1>Hours, Not Years</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Repayment is tied to hours worked, not to fixed time limits. A mentee may fulfill their commitment quickly or over a lifetime. This structure gives MentorGuilds a strong incentive to protect their mentees from burnout, unpaid work, or toxic workplaces that shorten careers.</p>
            <p>MentorGuilds are motivated to promote balance—encouraging rest, further study, and even sabbaticals that reignite passion and performance. Their goal is simple: ensure mentees work at their best, not just work the most. </p>
            <p>This approach transforms Education from a one-time transaction into a lifelong partnership for growth and sustainability.</p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>Influence Without Authority</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds cannot control their mentees’ personal or professional choices. They can only advise and hope their guidance is respected. Their influence depends entirely on trust and earned respect—on soft power, not control.</p>
            <p>MentorGuilds are free to experiment. They can use different methods, technologies, and rhythms of learning. </p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>MentorGuild Roles for Mentees</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Over time, MentorGuilds may adopt multiple roles to better serve their mentees—even roles that extend beyond work related Education.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Teacher:</b> Deliver skills directly.</li>
              <li><b>Mentor:</b> Fund external courses while providing more general guidance and support focused on making mentees independent.</li>
              <li><b>Guild:</b> Build a community of peers who support each other.</li>
              <li><b>Talent Agent:</b> Find opportunities and assist in negotiations.</li>
              <li><b>Career Coach:</b> Guide mentees toward smart, long-term career moves.</li>
              <li><b>Workers’ Advocate:</b> Protect mentees from abuse or exploitation.</li>
              <li><b>Stock Market and Private Safety Net:</b> Allowing mentees to raise funds for Education or personal needs in exchange for a share of future income. This helps them navigate early challenges or unexpected setbacks.</li>
              <li><b>Student Loan Alternative:</b> Offer Education without the burden of mandatory repayments.</li>
              <li><b>Second Family:</b> Create a lasting support network that extends beyond work.</li>
              <li><b>Science and Industry Evangelist:</b> Spread discoveries and best practices that improve both productivity and well-being.</li>
              <li><b>Wellness Coach:</b> Encourage recovery, rest, and balance.</li>
              <li><b>Therapist:</b> Help mentees overcome personal struggles that limit growth.</li>
              <li><b>Life Coach:</b> Foster healthy relationships and prevent emotional setbacks from derailing careers.</li>
              <li><b>Financial Advisor:</b> Teach saving, investing, and spending habits that build stability.</li>
              <li><b>Librarian:</b> Keep knowledge organized, current, and accessible.</li>
              <li><b>Drill Sergeant:</b> Instill discipline and mastery of fundamentals.</li>
              <li><b>Social Worker:</b> Support mentees through difficult life events.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>MentorGuild Roles for Society</h1>
          <div>
            <p>By helping individuals thrive, MentorGuilds also serve the greater good.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Launchpads for Educational Innovation:</b> Their freedom to experiment will create new forms of Education.</li>
              <li><b>Economic Bridge Between Social Classes:</b> Successful professionals will have incentives to mentor the underprivileged, spreading opportunity where it is needed most.</li>
              <li><b>Healing Multi-Generational Habits and Traumas:</b> By addressing trauma and self-sabotage, MentorGuilds can break negative cycles that echo through families and communities.</li>
              <li><b>Solving Localized Problems:</b> They can specialize—training tradespeople in underserved areas or helping ex-convicts reintegrate into society.</li>
              <li><b>Basic research:</b> Over time, MentorGuilds may sponsor basic research to gain a competitive edge.</li>
              <li><b>Refugees and Local Mentors:</b> Local mentors can guide newcomers through laws, culture and job markets.</li>
              <li><b>Mentoring Nations One Mentees at the Time:</b> International MentorGuilds can raise living standards one mentee at a time, creating connections, building empathy and reducing conflict.</li>
              <li><b>Simple Guidance for Complex / Changing Markets:</b> They can help society make sense of a chaotic job market by showing which skills and careers are rising, stable, or fading.</li>
              <li><b>Empowering Individuals in a Collectivist Corporate World:</b> In a corporate world tilted toward organizations with an abundance of advisors, MentorGuilds can help individuals negotiate and protect themselves.</li>
              <li><b>Spotting Near Enemies and Guiding Better Life Choices:</b> They can teach mentees to recognize and avoid exploitative marketing and wasteful consumption.</li>
              <li><b>Intergenerational Connector:</b> Older mentors can find renewed purpose while supporting younger mentees, fostering empathy and balance across age groups.</li>
              <li><b>Flighting Regulatory Capture:</b> MentorGuilds could be incentivized to dismantle regulatory capture of industries or regions, as this could provide more opportunities for their mentees.</li>
              <li><b>Incentives for Innovation in a Patentless Economy:</b> Without patents, MentorGuilds would still promote invention—rewarding results through shared success rather than monopolies.</li>

          <h1>Fundamentally Different from ISAs</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds may look similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_share_agreement" target="_blank">Income Sharing Agreements (ISAs)</a> at first glance—they both involve sharing a portion of future income—but the resemblance ends there. The two are built on completely different foundations.
            </p>

            <table>
              <tr>
                <th>Income Sharing Agreements</th>
                <th>MentorGuilds</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Based on years, creating <b>short-term</b> incentives—to maximize income during that period, even at the expense of long-term health or stability.</td>
                <td>Based on hours worked, creating <b>long-term</b> incentives—to rest when needed, protect mental and physical well-being, and build lasting prosperity.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Provide access to Education only <b>before</b> a career begins.</td>
                <td>Provide Education <b>before and throughout</b> a career.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Offer financial access to Education only.</td>
                <td>Offer Education and comprehensive support, including:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Roles such as talent agent, workers’ advocate, guild, or wellness coach.</li>
                    <li>Direct financial assistance when needed.</li>
                    <li>Ongoing advice through a career.</li>
                  </ul>
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Contractual and transactional</td>
                <td>Community-driven and long-term relationships</td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>In essence, ISAs are a way to finance traditional Education. MentorGuilds are a way to build a long-term partnership for career and personal growth.</p>

          <h1>MentorGuilds Risks</h1>
          <div>
            <p>While MentorGuilds offer major benefits to both mentees and society, they also carry real risks, for example: a MentorGuild could slip into a form of indentured servitude. It could try to micromanage its mentees’ lives. Or mentees could become overly dependent on their MentorGuilds for advice and
              support.</p>
            <p>To prevent such outcomes, we introduce strong framework of checks and balances is essential. Mentees have clear and powerful rights and protections, while MentorGuilds face strict limits and firm penalties for misconduct.</p>
          </div>
        </article>


        <article>
          <h1>The Power of Open Data</h1>
          <div>
            <p>One of the most powerful safeguards—and one of the greatest benefits to society—is the MentorGuild open data requirement. Every mentee’s complete contract will be publicly available, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The full contract terms, such as repayment percentage and total work hours.</li>
              <li>The skills delivered</li>
              <li>Ongoing monthly updates of income and work hours</li>
              <li>Mentee commentaries on their experience.</li>
              <li>Mentee identification is redacted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This level of transparency will give journalists, researchers, potential mentees, governments, investors, and industry participants a clear view of which skills, industries, and MentorGuilds are thriving and which are falling behind. It will send strong signals that drive smarter, more efficient economic
              choices.</p>
            <p>It will also make abuse hard to hide. Exploitative workloads or suspiciously inflated incomes will stand out in plain sight.</p>
            <p>Transparency will make society smarter, fairer, and more efficient.</p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds are organizations built on proper incentives. Their mission is to equip people with the skills to thrive—at work and in life. They are not rigid, centrally planned systems with fixed teaching methods. They are launchpads for educational innovation, designed to evolve with their mentees and
              the world around them.</p>
