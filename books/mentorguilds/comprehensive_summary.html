          <h1>Intro</h1>
          <div>
            <p>The lack of access to quality education is a major contributor trapping struggling populations, cutting them off from good jobs and opportunities to build their own businesses. This creates a cycle where families without access to proper education cannot provide it to their children, deepening inequality
              with each generation.</p>

            <p>While technology and society move forward at full speed, traditional education systems move at a crawl. This, combined with the high cost of education, has resulted in a growing gap between the skills the world needs and the skills the population actually has.</p>

          </div>

        <article>
          <h1>The Core Flaws of the Traditional Education System</h1>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Trampled Students:</b> The system marches forward even when some fall behind, leaving lasting psychological scars.</li>
              <li><b>Missing Essentials:</b> Many critical skills are missing, and much of the content and methodologies are outdated, leaving graduates unprepared for work and life.</li>
              <li><b>Wastefulness:</b> Courses are cluttered with outdated content and methods, kept alive by tradition or decisions by committee rather than relevance.</li>
              <li><b>Misleading Information on Prospects:</b> Students are often misled about salaries, career paths and job realities.</li>
              <li><b>Untimely Learning:</b> Even valuable lessons arrive too early or too late—like teaching management to those who have never held a job.</li>
              <li><b>Inadequate Assessment Methods:</b> Tests and grades rarely reflect the skills needed in real life or the job market.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Other problems—such as high tuition fees and student debt—are in part symptoms of these deeper flaws. Wasteful programs and false promises make inflated prices easier to justify, while curriculums that omit essential skills lead to poor job prospects, leaving graduates unable to repay the cost of their
              Education.</p>

            <p>
              When graduates struggle, educators face no penalty. When they succeed—even becoming billionaires—educators gain upside is little, unpredictable or nothing. With no stake in their students’ long-term outcomes, institutions have little motivation to deliver Education that truly works.
            </p>

            <p>
              By the time graduates face real-world challenges, traditional institutions have already laughed all the way to the bank, having been paid—whether through tuition or taxpayer funding. They have no skin in the game.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the root problems is simple: misaligned incentives between educators and students.
            </p>

            <p>However, even if education worked perfectly, many people would still be unable to afford it—or to pause work long enough to study. Education is costly not only in tuition, loans or taxes but also in lost time and opportunity.</p>

            <p>In essence, the traditional education system suffers from two core problems:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Low Quality:</b> Caused by misaligned incentives between educators and students; resulting in Trampled Students, Missing Essentials, Wastefulness, Misleading Information on Prospects, Untimely Learning and Inadequate Assessment Methods.</li>
              <li><b>High Cost:</b> For learners, in both direct and indirect expenses.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These issues affect both public and private institutions, whether funded directly through tuition and loans or indirectly through taxpayers.</p>

        <article>
          <h1>MentorGuilds: The Solution</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds are our proposed novel/unique/single-purpose legal organization, designed to solve these problems. MentorGuild objectives are:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>MUST</b> are core objectives that every MentorGuild must achieve:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Quality and Ongoing Education and Support:</b> Deliver real-world work and life skills through high — quality education and personalized mentorship—either by providing skills directly or funding access to top external courses—while ensuring continued guidance that helps individuals thrive.</li>
                  <li><b>Flexibility and Adaptability:</b> Promote rapid feedback loops for adaptation to changing industries, economies, and individual needs through diverse structures and approaches.</li>
                  <li><b>Sustainability:</b> At minimum, operate through a self-sustaining business model that does not rely largely on ongoing donations, grants, or government funding. Whether structured as for-profit or non-profit, MentorGuilds should aim to generate enough value to cover their costs, grow their
                    impact, and
                    attract long-term talent, capital, and commitment.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b>SHOULD</b> be achieved, but not at the expense of MUST objectives:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Fund tuition:</b> Enable students to access education at little or no upfront cost, especially for those unable to pay in the short term.</li>
                  <li><b>Fund stipends:</b> Provide financial support so mentees can sustain themselves and their families while focusing on education and early career growth.</li>
                  <li><b>Transparency:</b> Offer a clear, open view of which skills and industries are growing or declining, enabling smarter decisions by individuals, businesses, and policymakers.</li>
                  <li><b>Decrease Inequality:</b> Create incentives for the more advantaged — whether wealthy investors, successful professionals, accomplished retirees looking to stay engaged, or developed countries/regions — to help those who are struggling, through mentorship or investments.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Core features of MentorGuilds to fulfill these objectives are:</p>

            <article>
              <h2>1) Funding Model</h2>
              <div>
                <p>MentorGuilds will operate under strict rules unlike any other type of organization. One of them, is that they can earn income only from their mentees, and only in two ways:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Primary income: A share of their mentees’ after-tax future income, paid only for hours worked in jobs that largely use the skills the MentorGuild provided. Example: a mentee contributes 5.1% of their income for the next 9,200 relevant work hours.</li>
                  <li>Secondary income: A smaller portion may come from optional tuition paid directly by mentees.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are no loans, interest rates, hidden clauses, or penalties. No compounding balances, fixed repayment schedules, third-party collections, or credit reporting. Mentees never owe money unless they earn it. If they do not find a job or choose to leave the field they trained for, they owe nothing.
                </p>

                <p>This may look similar to Income Share Agreements (ISAs) or Income Contingent Loans (ICLs), but <a href="#alternatives-to-funding-education">later we will compare the fundamental differences</a>.</p>

                <p>When mentees succeed, MentorGuilds succeed. When mentees struggle, both share the loss. This shared fate builds accountability and keeps MentorGuilds focused on real outcomes, not empty promises or outdated practices. It also gives them a powerful incentive to select and train mentees carefully,
                  ensuring that each person is well-suited to their chosen industry and capable of thriving there for the long term.</p>

                <p>Repayment is tied to hours worked, not fixed time limits or total financial amounts. A mentee may fulfill their commitment quickly or gradually over a lifetime. This structure encourages sustainable productivity, protecting mentees from burnout, depression, unpaid labor, or toxic workplaces.</p>

                <p>MentorGuilds are motivated to promote balance—encouraging rest, continued learning, and even sabbaticals that reignite motivation and performance. Their mission is simple: help mentees work at their best, not work the most. This transforms education from a one-time transaction into a lifelong
                  partnership built on growth, sustainability, and mutual success.</p>
              </div>
            </article>

            <article>
              <h2>2) Open Data</h2>
              <div>
                <p>MentorGuilds will regularly publish and update key data that will stay permanently available to the public online. This information includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A list of every mentee contract ever offered (<a href="964219" target="_blank">example</a>)</li>
                  <li>The full text of each contract, including mentee feedback on their experience and any legal changes made by court rulings (<a href="964219/contracts/5301" target="_blank">example</a>)</li>
                  <li>A list of all updates made to a contract (<a href="964219/contracts/5301/changelog/" target="_blank">example</a>)</li>
                  <li>Cohort-level historical performance data, such as income and work hours, while respecting privacy laws (<a href="964219/cohort_performance/2024Q1" target="_blank">example</a>)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This data will not only be published on the MentorGuild website, but also automatically sent to central repositories mandated by governments. These could be government agencies or non-profit organizations that display the data in user-friendly dashboards and visualizations comparing all MentorGuilds.
                  The data will also be available in machine-readable formats for easy access and integration by anyone.</p>

                <p>This level of transparency will give journalists, researchers, potential mentees, governments, investors, entrepreneurs, competitors, industry participants and the general population a clear view of which skills, industries, and MentorGuilds are thriving and which are falling behind. It will send
                  strong signals that drive smarter, more efficient economic choices.</p>

                <p>It will also make many types of abuse hard to hide. Exploitative workloads or suspiciously inflated incomes will stand out in plain sight. The goal is simple: to make MentorGuilds the most transparent and publicly scrutinized institutions in society.</p>

                <p>All mentee data will be anonymized, and the best practices of privacy research will be applied. Re-identifying individual mentees will be highly unlikely, especially since no geographic data will be included. Most MentorGuild operations will function online. Even when a MentorGuild has a physical location, mentees can receive training on site and then return to their own — often distant — locations, further reducing the chance of identification.

            <article>
              <h2>3) Freedom</h2>
              <div>
                <p>MentorGuilds can take many different forms, adapting to their mission, context, and the needs of their mentees:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>They can operate as non-profits, cooperatives, or for-profit entities.</li>
                  <li>They may be small, specialized groups focused on niche skills or industries, or broad organizations delivering skills such as coding, design, or marketing—useful across many fields.</li>
                  <li>They can range from large organizations with thousands of mentors across multiple disciplines to a single mentor guiding just a few mentees.</li>
                  <li>They may be local, community-based groups or global networks using digital tools to connect mentors and mentees across borders.</li>
                  <li>They can focus on traditional trades like carpentry, plumbing, or electrical work, or emerging fields such as AI development, renewable energy, or biotechnology.</li>
                  <li>They can target specific demographics—such as underrepresented groups, career changers, or lifelong learners—or remain open to anyone interested in their area of expertise.</li>
                  <li>They may offer flexible, modular learning paths tailored to each mentee’s goals, or provide structured, long-form programs similar to traditional education when appropriate.</li>
                  <li>They can embrace modern technologies like AI, VR, and e-learning platforms, or adopt a fully offline approach built on in-person mentorship and hands-on training.</li>
                  <li>They can outsource the teaching to outside specialists, or develop their own in-house training programs.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The freedom to adapt quickly—to shifting industries, economic realities, and the evolving needs of each mentee throughout different stages of life and career—is one of the MentorGuild model’s greatest strengths.</p>

                <p>
                  The name <b>MentorGuild</b> was chosen to reflect two key roles they will likely play:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li><b>Mentor:</b> Emphasizing the personalized guidance and support offered to each mentee, tailored to their unique needs and goals. The goal is to help mentees become as self-reliant as possible. Unlike teachers, who deliver skills directly, mentors will probably curate the best available education
                    and fund their mentees’ access to top external instructors, complementing those with their own materials when needed.</li>
                  <li><b>Guild:</b> Capturing the community spirit of collaboration and shared growth, where members exchange knowledge, support one another, and remain connected through both successes and challenges.</li>
                </ul>

              </div>
            </article>
          </div>

        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>Profits</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Preliminary calculations suggest that MentorGuilds could be highly profitable. A contribution of roughly 5% of income over 9,200 relevant work hours — about five years of full-time employment—could yield profitability similar to that of many vocational trade schools and technology bootcamps.</p>

            <p>Beyond this baseline, several unique advantages can further enhance sustainability and profitability:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Efficient Mentoring: Mentoring is far less time-consuming than traditional teaching. MentorGuilds focus on curating the best available education and funding their mentees’ access to top external instructors, while supplementing those resources with their own internal materials when needed.</li>
              <li>Minimal Overhead: MentorGuilds do not require physical locations. They can operate entirely online, meeting mentees in person only when necessary and in public spaces. </li>
              <li>Economies of Scale:
                <ul>
                  <li>Shared tools, platforms, and learning resources that benefit all mentees.</li>
                  <li>Community networks where mentees support each other within small pods or entire community.</li>
                  <li>A centralized and growing online platform, where communication can happen asynchronously, allowing mentees/mentors to connect and collaborate on their own schedules, having common questions answered, and opportunities for AI to assist.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>We also <strong>strongly encourage</strong> two policy measures that would drastically reduce administrative and compliance costs, making MentorGuilds fairer, more sustainable, and more scalable:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Tax exemption:</b> This would prevent double taxation (given the mentee income is already taxed), promote education and new economic data as a national priority, and offset the exceptionally strict transparency and operational requirements MentorGuilds must follow.</li>
              <li><b>Mentors as legal partners:</b> Recognizing mentors as partners would align incentives and reflect their role as part-time professionals who remain active in their industries. These mentors would operate independently, share in repayments rather than receive fixed salaries, and avoid traditional
                employment costs.</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Beyond financial returns, MentorGuilds will also have many intangible benefits, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Early access to emerging trends in technology, markets, and culture through exposure to mentees</li>
              <li>Building strong professional networks</li>
              <li>Gathering high-quality industry data</li>
              <li>Gaining reputation and media exposure</li>
              <li>The opportunity to advise governments and participate in public debate</li>
              <li>Experiencing the deep satisfaction of helping others succeed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              With low operating costs, scalable online delivery, and incentives tied directly to mentee success, MentorGuilds have the potential to generate significant long-term returns for founders, investors, and mentors alike.
            </p>

            <p>MentorGuilds are designed for most professions—from nannies, hairdressers, plumbers and electricians to software developers, doctors, and executives. In their early stages, they will likely focus on careers with fast, high returns on investment. Over time, however, they can expand to include nearly every
              field—even those traditionally seen as low-paying. With the help of specialized mentors who combine unique skills and tailored guidance, MentorGuilds could make these professions more sustainable and better rewarded.</p>

        <article>
          <h1>Why not Improve Traditional Education?</h1>
          <div>
            <p>
              Are we exaggerating the problems with traditional education? Some institutions are really good. And must we really sell part of our future income to receive an education? Education is a human right. Should governments not provide it for free or heavily subsidize it? Should society not focus on improving
              the institutions we already have?
            </p>

            <p>Some traditional education institutions are indeed better than others. Many vocational schools deliver skills that are immediately useful in the marketplace. Many educational philosophies (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education" target="_blank">Montessori</a>, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education" target="_blank">Waldorf-Steiner</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_school" target="_blank">Sudbury</a>) allow students to be more self-paced, avoiding trampled students.</p>

            <p>However, while some traditional institutions address some <a href="#the-core-flaws-of-the-traditional-education-system">core flaws</a>, they often leave others untouched. And none are long-term partnerships with their students. None provide meaningful continuous education and support during careers. None
              are so thoroughly rewarded or punished based on how well graduates perform in the marketplace, as MentorGuilds will be.</p>

            <p>MentorGuilds are necessary because they are uniquely incentivized to address every core flaw in traditional education, copy the parts that traditional education does well, and be a long-term partnership on top of that. And then scale this solution massively, in a publicly visible way through open data.
            </p>

            <p>That is why we present traditional education versus MentorGuilds as an easy contrast. In truth, this simplifies how different traditional institutions can be from each other. But the simplification is warranted to avoid details that do not impact next steps. The average traditional education institution
              does have all the core flaws we mentioned. Most fall somewhere on the spectrum - some have more flaws than others.</p>

            <p>
              Improving traditional education is a noble goal, but in practice it faces enormous obstacles. Both public and private institutions struggle with limited budgets, heavy bureaucracy, entrenched interests, and deep resistance to change. Reform efforts are often slow, superficial, fragmented, and easily
              disrupted by political cycles or funding cuts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Even if governments and traditional institutions had unlimited time and money, they would still struggle to align education with the real needs of the job market and daily life. Free or subsidized education has little value if graduates remain unprepared to survive and thrive in the real world. Without
              aligned incentives, educators and learners stay disconnected.
            </p>

            <p>
              MentorGuilds close this gap by directly aligning the interests of educators and learners, creating a self-sustaining system that rewards real-world success.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over time, once MentorGuilds are well established and have a proven track record, governments may choose to integrate with them - by funding tuition for high-risk students (such as ex-convicts) or allowing students to redirect existing public education budgets toward the MentorGuild of their choice,
              continuing to provide education as a human right or strategic investment. These contributions would reduce the risks MentorGuilds take, enabling them to lower repayment factors (income percentage and total work hours) while keeping incentives properly aligned.
            </p>

            <p>
              The open data required of MentorGuilds will also help policymakers design smarter education, workforce, and investment strategies - guided by real, transparent results.
            </p>

        <article>
          <h1>The Power of Aligned Incentives for Work and Life</h1>
          <div>
            <p>
              MentorGuilds are designed to deliver high-quality education and personalized support, tailored to the specific needs and abilities of each mentee. Their goal is not only to provide better education than traditional systems but also to offer <b>continuous and real-world guidance</b> that connects both
              <b>work and life</b>.
              In a fast-changing world, where professional and personal challenges often overlap, this holistic approach is essential. Over time, it has the potential to transform not only individual lives but entire societies.
            </p>

            <p>
              The reason for this broad range of support is simple: anything that harms a mentee’s work quality or productivity will also harm the MentorGuild’s income and reputation — especially under the open data requirement. That is why successful MentorGuilds will adopt a holistic approach to their mentees’
              well-being, offering guidance and resources that extend far beyond traditional job training. In essence, the most effective MentorGuilds will teach not only work skills, but life skills.
            </p>

            <p>However, all this guidance remains optional. Mentees are free to make their own choices. MentorGuilds can advise — but never control.</p>

          <h1>Alternatives to Funding Education</h1>
          <div>
            <p>At first glance, MentorGuilds may appear to be just another way to finance tuition — an alternative to free or subsidized programs, student loans, or income-based repayment models.</p>
            <p>But funding tuition is only one of the MentorGuild's objectives.</p>
            <p>Even when financing is the main focus, MentorGuilds can offer complementary roles. In highly regulated professions such as medicine, a MentorGuild’s primary role might be to finance tuition for a university degree. Yet their contribution does not end there. They can also provide stipends so students can
              study without the strain of part-time jobs, and continue supporting them after graduation — helping them find work, negotiate contracts, or navigate early career challenges.</p>

            <p>Although MentorGuilds may seem similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_share_agreement" target="ISAs">Income Sharing Agreements (ISAs)</a> or <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/dtc-finance-toolkit-factsheets/income-contingent-loans-icls" target="ICLs">Income Contingent Loans (ICLs)</a>
              — since all involve sharing a portion of future income in exchange for education — the resemblance is only superficial.</p>

            <p>Let us now examine the key differences between MentorGuilds and Education funding models. There are always exceptions, but in general:</p>

            <p>In essence, if a potential student finds a traditional education provider that fully meets their needs — free of <a href="#the-core-flaws-of-the-traditional-education-system">major flaws</a>—and does not need support or guidance beyond the classroom, then free or subsidized education, student loans,
              ISAs,
              or ICLs may be all that is needed.</p>

            <p>For everyone else, MentorGuilds provide added value: Education and repayments built on shared incentives, curated learning paths, and mentorship that continues long after graduation.</p>


            <p>In terms of comparisons, it is worth mentioning alternatives that made similar claims as MentorGuilds. A commonly cited example was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_Institute_of_Technology" target="_blank">Bloom Institute of Technology</a>, which not only provided education in IT, but also
              used
              ISAs, so their students would pay back with a percentage of their salaries instead of upfront tuition. This kept accountability for graduate outcomes. They also promised long-term support. </p>

            <p>But they were accused of many problems, such as inflated or misrepresented job placement statistics, claimed higher graduate salaries than actually achieved, complex contract terms that were hard for students to understand, and graduates pushed into jobs just to meet placement
              statistics, regardless of job quality. Some students also complained that as the company scaled rapidly, educational quality reportedly declined.</p>

            <p>Many features of MentorGuilds were designed explicitly to avoid these problems:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Bloom sold part of their ISA contracts to other companies, losing the incentives and accountability for the quality of their education or success of their students. One of many restrictions MentorGuilds will have is that they are explicitly forbidden from transferring
                or selling their mentee contracts, unless under very specific circumstances, and always only after approval of the mentee. MentorGuilds will remain accountable for their students until the very end.</li>

              <li><strong>Simple contracts:</strong> Ideally, the mentee contracts will be standardized and written into government law, discussed and sharpened by public discourse before implementation, and visible to all. A fallback can be a public master contract, like the long-used <a
                  href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Licenses</a>. Each individual mentee contract is relatively simple (<a href="/books/mentorguilds/964219/contracts/5301" target="_blank">example</a>) because it just fills in variables, such as income percentage, number of
                worked hours, and lists of skills. This will allow every mentee to inherit every safeguard and make contracts easy to compare. Other measures to educate the public about how MentorGuilds work, and mentee rights and obligations, will also be available.</li>

              <li><strong>Open Data:</strong> Publicly visible contracts will make unfair terms bad for reputation. The open performance data (ideally automatically published <strong>without</strong> going through the MentorGuild), with its income and work hours (<a
                  href="/books/mentorguilds/964219/cohort_performance/2024Q1" target="_blank">example</a>), will make it difficult to falsify or cherry-pick
                data in terms of realistic income and work expectations. Decrease in education quality will be visible in cohort performance, alerting the public and potential mentees. It will also be possible to derive other useful indicators, like time to job placements, seasonality, vacations, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In essence, many dangers from previous models were analyzed and measures to prevent them were baked into the MentorGuild model. Undoubtedly, new dangers will arise over time, and those can be dealt with by amending the model, making it a living and evolving institution like any other in society, while
              preserving its <a href="#mentorguilds-the-solution">objectives and core features</a>.</p>

          <h1>Risks</h1>
          <div>
            <p>While MentorGuilds promise major benefits, they also carry real risks, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The scope of contracts could generate litigation and uncertainty. Could a MentorGuild write generic skills that cover nearly every job? Who decides if a job largely uses the skills delivered? What if the mentee moves to a jurisdiction with different laws?</li>
              <li>MentorGuilds could drift toward exploitation — becoming predatory, manipulative, or overly controlling.</li>
              <li>The relationship could degenerate into a new kind of indentured servitude.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To reduce these and other risks, the <a href="#2-open-data">Open Data requirement</a> mandates transparency in key MentorGuild operations, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>a lenghty sigining of the contract, during which period the contract will be available online to be scrutinizedb by competitors or the general public, including abusive terms or too many generic skills</li>
              <li>judges will be able to compare contracts between comeptitors, to easily decide if a particular contract aligns with industry standards</li>
            </ul>


            <p>To further protect mentees, MentorGuilds have no authority over their mentees' personal or professional decisions. They can only advise, not command. Their influence relies entirely on trust, credibility, and earned respect — on soft power rather than control.</p>

            <p>We also have many other measures to ensure fair treatment and prevent abuse by all sides, which are unfortunately too lengthy to elaborate on in a summary like this. Suffice to say that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mentees are granted extensive rights and protections</li>
              <li>Governments are granted oversight mechanisms</li>
              <li>MentorGuilds operate under strict limits, facing firm penalties for any form of misconduct</li>
              <li>Mechanisms exist to resolve disagreements about MentorGuild contract scope in a mutually beneficial way</li>
            </ul>

            <article>
              <h2>Matching Skills and Jobs</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Having "income from a job that <strong>largely uses the skills</strong> provided" as a core feature of MentorGuilds might seem counterintuitive, risky, and unnecessarily complex. It would make rules and enforcement much easier to count income from any job, like most ISAs and ICLs do. However, that
                  would immensely weaken the model:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Lack of accountability:</strong> If any job qualifies, MentorGuilds would be tempted to admit individuals who are already likely to succeed regardless of training - those with strong motivation, intelligence, or privilege. They could offer shallow, generic content, then claim credit for
                    students' future earnings in unrelated fields. This mirrors the downsides of most ISAs, where students report feeling deceived, having to pay for an education they do not use. By tying repayment only to jobs that substantially apply the acquired skills, MentorGuilds are held accountable for
                    delivering real, targeted value.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Transparency and data integrity:</strong> If income is disconnected from skill application, there is no clear signal about which skills are genuinely helping people succeed. This dilutes the data that could otherwise guide students, educators, and policymakers. A system that tracks which
                    MentorGuilds teach which skills - and how well those skills translate into relevant jobs - would create an evidence-based map of what works. This would allow future learners to make better choices, guide government investment, help industries forecast labor pipelines, and even reveal emerging fields
                    before they hit the mainstream.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <strong>Ethical and social legitimacy:</strong> Society is more likely to support a model where repayment is fair, transparent, and tightly linked to actual impact. If students end up working in retail or hospitality because their training failed, it would be deeply unjust for the MentorGuild to
                    still profit from their unrelated income. By contrast, a model that restricts repayment to jobs that meaningfully use the taught skills respects the principle of merit-based value capture, strengthening trust in the entire system.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Nonetheless, there can be subjectivity in deciding if a job largely uses the skills provided.</p>

                <p>When a student starts a new job, both parties evaluate whether it qualifies based on job title, description, occupational codes, primary responsibilities, and industry sector (where the skills are typically applied). If more precision is needed, the rule of thumb is this: at least 50% of the role's
                  core duties - excluding general-purpose tasks like scheduling, routine reporting, or admin - directly rely on the specialized skills listed in the contract. For most cases, this evaluation will be straightforward and both parties quickly agree. Once a job is certified as qualifying (or not), that
                  determination stands unless the role changes significantly.</p>

                <p>In a worst case scenario, this could lead to endless disagreements and litigation and make the whole model financially unviable. However, there are several tools in the MentorGuild toolbox to prevent this:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Mutual interest:</strong> If a student falsely claims that their job does not largely use the skills provided, MentorGuilds could start allocating fewer resources to the student without breaking the contract. They could stop answering the student as promptly, or not invite them to paid
                    bootcamps anymore, for example. This happens because while the skills of a job are subjective, so is the quality of education. Both MentorGuild and student can use subjectivity to take advantage of each other. However, this is not in the best interest of either of them. The student would receive
                    worse education, negatively impacting their job performance, and the MentorGuild would have this negatively impact their public data. In this way, they are both incentivized to behave honestly and do the best for each other. This partnership is key to their success.</li>

                  <li><strong>Updating active contracts:</strong> Any career has evolving needs. This could happen because workers start specializing in their field, or because their field or life circumstances have changed, resulting in some skills not being needed anymore and new skills being required. MentorGuilds
                    and students can agree to add or remove skills from an active contract. This is a very important feature of MentorGuilds, allowing them to provide more personalized education to match a student's needs and providing critical and incredibly valuable public data on which skills are useful or not
                    (visible in the contract changelog, <a href="/books/mentorguilds/964219/contracts/5301/changelog/" target="_blank">example</a>) and the resulting impact on cohort performance. So if the student's career or life needs are changing, it is in all parties' best interest to have a conversation and adjust their
                    educational path accordingly.</li>

                  <li><strong>Relinquished contracts:</strong> If student and MentorGuild cannot find common ground for whatever reason, the MentorGuild has the option to unilaterally give up on the contract, ending all obligations from both sides. This is very likely to benefit the former student, as they will have
                    received a large part of the benefits (such as skills or stipends) but not have to repay. This is not so great for the MentorGuild, who gives up on future income, and too many of these contracts in their open data would look bad. But this would prevent the relationship from becoming too strained,
                    which would also damage their reputation, and it would save them from investing further resources into an uncooperative student.</li>

                  <li><strong>Rolled over contracts:</strong> If a student's career specializes into a direction that a MentorGuild cannot support, this is not ideal for both sides, as the student's career will not thrive as much as possible. Fortunately, there is a MentorGuild mechanism for this occasion: signing a
                    three-way contract with a new MentorGuild who specializes in the new area. The old MentorGuild would keep a small percentage of income and keep providing education and support for the skills they specialize in and are still relevant, and the new MentorGuild would take another percentage of income to
                    provide new skills. To prevent abuse, any contract can only have up to two MentorGuilds. This would also provide valuable insights in the open data, as the operation would be transparent to the public. An example of how this could happen is <a
                      href="/articles/first_generation_mentorguilds/#specialization" target="_blank">available here</a>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In essence, the primary tool to avoid disagreements around matching skills and jobs is aligned incentives, which encourages all parties to resolve issues to their mutual benefit without involving external parties such as arbitrators or lawyers. This will also encourage students to continue paying
                  their MentorGuild, even if they move to a jurisdiction that does not require them to do so. It is in their best interest to continue receiving enthusiastic support from their MentorGuild.</p>

                <p>However, subjectivity is present in any contract, and if this needs to be addressed via lawyers and judges, they can act as impartial parties to apply the steps above and even use similar MentorGuild contracts in the field to get a summary of current industry-relevant skills.</p>

                <p>MentorGuilds not being paid when they should is indeed a risk, but there are many thriving models out there based on aligned incentives. Venture capitalists, for example, invest in startups and risk the founders running away with money or wasting it. There are a few examples of this happening, but
                  the venture capital industry is still thriving nonetheless. Both are manageable risks via diversification and aligned incentives.</p>

                <p>In essence, attaching MentorGuilds to skills does introduce some complexity and risks, but these are manageable with the right tools and are well worth the benefits to students and society.</p>

                <p>We need to acknowledge that MentorGuild rules are explicitly designed to protect students, given the nature and risks of this new kind of institution. But if this goes too far, it could be unfair to MentorGuilds, leading them to be extremely selective about who they admit, which is not in the best
                  interest of anyone. If that happens in the future, rules can be revised to restore balance.</p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds are organizations built to align the interests of students and educators. Their mission is to help people develop the skills needed to thrive — both in their careers and in their personal lives.</p>
            <p>Unlike rigid, centrally planned systems bound by fixed teaching methods, MentorGuilds serve as launchpads for innovation and fast learning. They evolve alongside their students, using quick feedback loops to adapt to an ever-changing world.</p>
            <p>By combining aligned incentives, transparency, and strict organizational rules, MentorGuilds aim to narrow the widening gap between the skills society demands and the skills people possess. They achieve this not only by providing high-quality education, but also by helping students manage its financial cost.</p>
            <p>Still, MentorGuilds face real challenges, like an unproven track record and legal / regulatory uncertainty.  The key question is not whether they are flawless — no system is — but whether they can deliver better outcomes than current alternatives for enough people to justify the risks, effort, and experimentation required for this model to grow naturally.</p>
            <p>The next step is clear: MentorGuilds should begin as pilot programs. If results are strong, they should scale quickly. Their open-data approach will make progress transparent and easy for everyone to monitor.</p>

          <h1>Key Concept: Education</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Many define Education as the simple acquisition of knowledge. But knowledge alone is far from enough to survive—let alone thrive—in work or in life.
            </p>

            <p>Education, in its ideal state, is the process by which individuals or entities (like groups, companies, governments, society) acquire <b>knowledge, skills, social capital, and meta-Education</b>; with the purpose to not only survive but thrive in the marketplace or life in general.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Knowledge:</b> the theoretical understanding of various subjects including foundational concepts, technologies, tools, methodologies, best practices, mental models, historical context, customers, regulations, traditions, and trends.</li>
              <li><b>Skills:</b> the practical application of knowledge to perform tasks efficiently and quickly. This is knowledge put into action. Skills include both those specific to one’s field and general abilities such as matching the right knowledge to a real-world problem, digital literacy, negotiation, time
                management, prioritizing, decision making, and problem-solving.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The next two areas also involve knowledge and skills in large parts, but they are important enough to deserve their own categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Social capital:</b> the web of relationships and skills that build trust and reputation—both among peers and with strangers. It is essential for creating strong networks and navigating social environments effectively. Social capital can be grouped into three key areas:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Self:</b> Skills applied to oneself, including active listening, effective communication, reading nonverbal cues, public speaking, offering help without being exploited, cultural sensitivity, social etiquette, conversation skills, conflict resolution, recognizing psychological issues in oneself
                    and others, political awareness, self-branding and marketing, and knowing how to build, maintain, and leverage contacts.</li>
                  <li><b>Indirect contacts:</b>following and learning from experts and thought leaders through social media, books, videos, podcasts, workshops, and conventions—while also understanding their strengths and limitations.</li>
                  <li><b>Direct contacts:</b> relationships with others in the field, from junior colleagues to senior professionals, as well as with clients, employers, stakeholders, mentors, and influential specialists. These connections allow for the exchange of advice, knowledge, and support, fostering mutual
                    growth and opportunity.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b>Meta-Education:</b> The art of learning. It covers effective learning techniques, staying motivated for continuous learning, and distinguishing between good and bad Education. It also includes developing self-awareness (knowing your own strengths and weaknesses), self-care, emotional intelligence,
                adaptability, critical thinking, and creativity.</li>
            </ul>
