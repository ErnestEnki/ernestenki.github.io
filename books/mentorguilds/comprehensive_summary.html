          <h1>Intro</h1>
          <div>
            <p>The lack of quality education traps struggling populations, cutting them off from good jobs and opportunities to build their own businesses. This creates a cycle where families without access to proper education cannot provide it to their children, deepening inequality with each generation.</p>
            <p>While technology and society move forward at full speed, traditional education systems move at a crawl. The result is a growing gap between the skills the world needs and the ones graduates actually have.</p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>The Core Flaws of the Traditional Education System</h1>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Trampled Students:</b> The system marches forward even when some fall behind, leaving lasting psychological scars.</li>
              <li><b>Missing Essentials:</b> Many critical skills are missing, and much of the content and methodologies are outdated, leaving graduates unprepared for work and life.</li>
              <li><b>Wastefulness:</b> Courses are cluttered with outdated content and methods, kept alive by tradition or decisions by committee rather than relevance.</li>
              <li><b>Misleading Information on Prospects:</b> Students are often misled about salaries, career paths and job realities.</li>
              <li><b>Untimely Learning:</b> Even valuable lessons arrive too early or too late—like teaching management to those who have never held a job.</li>
              <li><b>Inadequate Assessment Methods:</b> Tests and grades rarely reflect the skills needed in real life or the job market.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Other problems—such as high tuition fees and student debt—are in part symptoms of these deeper flaws. Wasteful programs and false promises make inflated prices easier to justify, while curriculums that omit essential skills lead to poor job prospects, leaving graduates unable to repay the cost of their
              Education.</p>

            <p>
              When graduates struggle, educators face no penalty. When they succeed—even becoming billionaires—educators gain nothing. With no stake in their students’ long-term outcomes, institutions have little motivation to deliver Education that truly works.
            </p>

            <p>
              By the time graduates face real-world challenges, traditional institutions have already laughed all the way to the bank, having been paid—whether through tuition or taxpayer funding. They have no skin in the game.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the root problems is simple: misaligned incentives between educators and students.
            </p>

            <p>However, even if education worked perfectly, many people would still be unable to afford it—or to pause work long enough to study. Education is costly not only in tuition, loans or taxes but also in lost time and opportunity.</p>

            <p>In essence, the traditional education system suffers from two core problems:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Low Quality:</b> Caused by misaligned incentives between educators and students; resulting in Trampled Students, Missing Essentials, Wastefulness, Misleading Information on Prospects, Untimely Learning and Inadequate Assessment Methods.</li>
              <li><b>High Cost:</b> For learners, in both direct and indirect expenses.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These issues affect both public and private institutions, whether funded directly through tuition and loans or indirectly through taxpayers.</p>

          <h1>MentorGuilds: The Solution</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds are our proposed novel/unique/single-purpose legal organization, designed to solve these problems. MentorGuild objectives are:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>MUST</b> are core objectives that every MentorGuild must achieve:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Quality and Ongoing Education and Support:</b> Deliver real-world work and life skills through high-quality education and personalized mentorship—either by providing skills directly or funding access to top external courses—while ensuring continued guidance that helps individuals thrive.</li>
                  <li><b>Flexibility and Adaptability:</b> Promote rapid feedback loops for adaptation to changing industries, economies, and individual needs through diverse structures and approaches.</li>
                  <li><b>Sustainability:</b> At minimum, operate through a self-sustaining business model that does not rely largely on ongoing donations, grants, or government funding. Whether structured as for-profit or non-profit, MentorGuilds should aim to generate enough value to cover their costs, grow their impact, and
                    attract long-term talent, capital, and commitment.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b>SHOULD</b> be achieved, but not at the expense of MUST objectives:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Fund tuition:</b> Enable students to access education at little or no upfront cost, especially for those unable to pay in the short term.</li>
                  <li><b>Fund stipends:</b> Provide financial support so mentees can sustain themselves and their families while focusing on education and early career growth.</li>
                  <li><b>Transparency:</b> Offer a clear, open view of which skills and industries are growing or declining, enabling smarter decisions by individuals, businesses, and policymakers.</li>
                  <li><b>Decrease Inequality:</b> Create incentives for the more advantaged—whether wealthy investors, successful professionals, accomplished retirees looking to stay engaged, or developed regions—to help those who are struggling, through mentorship or investments.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Core features of MentorGuilds to fulfill these objectives are:</p>

            <article>
              <h2>1) Funding Model</h2>
              <div>
                <p>MentorGuilds will operate under strict rules unlike any other type of organization. One of them, is that they can earn income only from their mentees, and only in two ways:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Primary income: A share of their mentees’ after-tax future income, paid only for hours worked in jobs that use the skills the MentorGuild helped provide. Example: a mentee contributes 5.1% of their income for the next 9,200 relevant work hours.</li>
                  <li>Secondary income: A smaller portion may come from optional tuition paid directly by mentees.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are no loans, interest rates, hidden clauses, or penalties. No compounding balances, fixed repayment schedules, third-party collections, or credit reporting. Mentees never owe money unless they earn it. If they do not find a job or choose to leave the field they trained for, they owe nothing.
                </p>

                <p>When mentees succeed, MentorGuilds succeed. When mentees struggle, both share the loss. This shared fate builds accountability and keeps MentorGuilds focused on real outcomes, not empty promises or outdated practices. It also gives them a powerful incentive to select and train mentees carefully,
                  ensuring that each person is well-suited to their chosen industry and capable of thriving there for the long term.</p>

                <p>Repayment is tied to hours worked, not fixed time limits or total financial amounts. A mentee may fulfill their commitment quickly or gradually over a lifetime. This structure encourages sustainable productivity, protecting mentees from burnout, depression, unpaid labor, or toxic workplaces.</p>

                <p>MentorGuilds are motivated to promote balance—encouraging rest, continued learning, and even sabbaticals that reignite motivation and performance. Their mission is simple: help mentees work at their best, not work the most. This transforms education from a one-time transaction into a lifelong
                  partnership built on growth, sustainability, and mutual success.</p>
              </div>
            </article>

            <article>
              <h2>2) Open Data</h2>
              <div>
                <p>MentorGuilds will regularly publish and update key data that will stay permanently available to the public online. All mentee data will be anonymized. This information includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A list of every mentee contract ever offered (<a href="964219" target="_blank">example</a>)</li>
                  <li>The full text of each contract, including mentee feedback on their experience and any legal changes made by court rulings (<a href="964219/contracts/5301" target="_blank">example</a>)</li>
                  <li>Cohort-level historical performance data — such as income and work hours (<a href="964219/cohort_performance/2024Q1" target="_blank">example</a>)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This level of transparency will give journalists, researchers, potential mentees, governments, investors, entrepreneurs, competitors, industry participants and the general population a clear view of which skills, industries, and MentorGuilds are thriving and which are falling behind. It will send
                  strong signals that drive smarter, more efficient economic
                  choices.</p>
                <p>It will also make many types of abuse hard to hide. Exploitative workloads or suspiciously inflated incomes will stand out in plain sight. The goal is simple: to make MentorGuilds the most transparent and publicly scrutinized institutions in society.</p>
              </div>
            </article>


            <article>
              <h2>3) Freedom</h2>
              <div>
                <p>MentorGuilds can take many different forms, adapting to their mission, context, and the needs of their mentees:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>They can operate as non-profits, cooperatives, or for-profit entities.</li>
                  <li>They may be small, specialized groups focused on niche skills or industries, or broad organizations delivering skills such as coding, design, or marketing—useful across many fields.</li>
                  <li>They can range from large organizations with thousands of mentors across multiple disciplines to a single mentor guiding just a few mentees.</li>
                  <li>They may be local, community-based groups or global networks using digital tools to connect mentors and mentees across borders.</li>
                  <li>They can focus on traditional trades like carpentry, plumbing, or electrical work, or emerging fields such as AI development, renewable energy, or biotechnology.</li>
                  <li>They can target specific demographics—such as underrepresented groups, career changers, or lifelong learners—or remain open to anyone interested in their area of expertise.</li>
                  <li>They may offer flexible, modular learning paths tailored to each mentee’s goals, or provide structured, long-form programs similar to traditional education when appropriate.</li>
                  <li>They can embrace modern technologies like AI, VR, and e-learning platforms, or adopt a fully offline approach built on in-person mentorship and hands-on training.</li>
                  <li>They can outsource the teaching to outside specialists, or develop their own in-house training programs.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The freedom to adapt quickly—to shifting industries, economic realities, and the evolving needs of each mentee throughout different stages of life and career—is one of the MentorGuild model’s greatest strengths.</p>

                <p>
                  The name <b>MentorGuild</b> was chosen to reflect two key roles they will likely play:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li><b>Mentor:</b> Emphasizing the personalized guidance and support offered to each mentee, tailored to their unique needs and goals. The goal is to help mentees become as self-reliant as possible. Unlike teachers, who deliver skills directly, mentors will probably curate the best available education
                    and fund their mentees’ access to top external instructors, complementing those with their own materials when needed.</li>
                  <li><b>Guild:</b> Capturing the community spirit of collaboration and shared growth, where members exchange knowledge, support one another, and remain connected through both successes and challenges.</li>
                </ul>

              </div>

        <article>
          <h1>Profits</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Preliminary calculations suggest that MentorGuilds could be highly profitable. A contribution of roughly 5% of income over 9,200 relevant work hours — about five years of full-time employment—could yield profitability similar to that of many vocational trade schools and technology bootcamps.</p>

            <p>Beyond this baseline, several unique advantages can further enhance sustainability and profitability:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Efficient Mentoring: Mentoring is far less time-consuming than traditional teaching. MentorGuilds focus on curating the best available education and funding their mentees’ access to top external instructors, while supplementing those resources with their own internal materials when needed.</li>
              <li>Minimal Overhead: MentorGuilds do not require physical locations. They can operate entirely online, meeting mentees in person only when necessary and in public spaces. </li>
              <li>Economies of Scale:
                <ul>
                  <li>Shared tools, platforms, and learning resources that benefit all mentees.</li>
                  <li>Community networks where mentees support each other within small pods or entire community.</li>
                  <li>A centralized and growing online platform, where communication can happen asynchronously, allowing mentees/mentors to connect and collaborate on their own schedules, having common questions answered, and opportunities for AI to assist.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>We also <strong>strongly encourage</strong> two policy measures that would drastically reduce administrative and compliance costs, making MentorGuilds fairer, more sustainable, and more scalable:</p>
            <article>
              <h2>1. Tax Exemption</h2>
              <div>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Avoiding double taxation:</b> The income has already been taxed at the individual level. A tax exemption aligns with how other pass-through income arrangements (like trusts or family transfers) are treated.</li>
                  <li><b>Encouraging education:</b> Education is a strategic national priority; exempting MentorGuilds supports this mission.</li>
                  <li><b>Enhancing market efficiency:</b> The open-data requirement provides valuable insights to society, making the entire economy more transparent and data-driven.</li>
                  <li><b>Balancing Operational Constraints:</b> Given their heavy transparency obligations, restrictions on other income sources and other strict rules, tax exemption would be a fair and necessary offset.</li>
                  <li><b>Global Competitiveness:</b> Countries that foster flexible, efficient, and results-oriented education alternatives will better equip their population for the future of work.</li>
                  <li><b>Precedent: </b> Many countries already offer tax benefits to institutions linked to education or public service: nonprofit universities, apprenticeship programs, even employer-provided tuition reimbursement.</li>
                  <li><b>Long Term raising of Taxes:</b> By raising the income of their mentees and encouraging them to open companies, MentorGuilds will raise tax revenue in the long run.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </article>

            <article>
              <h2>2. Mentors as Legal Partners</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Mentors should be legally recognized as partners within the MentorGuild model. This reflects their hybrid role as collaborators, educators, and investors in their mentees’ success.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Part-time professionals:</b> most mentors will likely be active in their industries, bringing current skills, insider knowledge, and real-world connections to their mentees. The partner structure allows for flexibility without requiring full-time roles.</li>
                  <li><b>No employment overhead:</b> As partners (similar to law firms or consultancies), mentors are not employees. They are self-employed, managing their own schedules and workloads. This removes the need for traditional employee benefits such as health insurance, paid leave, retirement contributions,
                    or workers’ compensation—especially when interactions are largely online and low-risk.</li>
                  <li><b>Aligned incentives:</b> Instead of fixed salaries or hourly rates, mentors earn a share of repayments or tuition collected from their mentees, ensuring their income reflects real outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </article>

            <p>
              Beyond financial returns, MentorGuilds and their mentors gain early access to emerging trends in technology, markets, and culture; build strong professional networks; gather high-quality industry data; and gain reputation, media exposure, and the opportunity to advise governments and participate in public
              debate—all while experiencing the deep satisfaction of helping others succeed.
            </p>


            <p>
              With low operating costs, scalable online delivery, and incentives tied directly to mentee success, MentorGuilds have the potential to generate significant long-term returns for founders, investors, and mentors alike.
            </p>

            <p>MentorGuilds are designed for most professions—from nannies, hairdressers, plumbers and electricians to software developers, doctors, and executives. In their early stages, they will likely focus on careers with fast, high returns on investment. Over time, however, they can expand to include nearly every
              field—even those traditionally seen as low-paying. With the help of specialized mentors who combine unique skills and tailored guidance, MentorGuilds could make these professions more sustainable and better rewarded.</p>

          <h1>Why not Improve Traditional Education?</h1>
          <div>
            <p>
              Must we really “sell” part of our future income to receive an Education? Education is a human right. Shouldn’t governments provide it for free or heavily subsidize it? Shouldn’t society focus on improving the quality of the institutions we already have?
            </p>
            <p>
              Improving traditional Education is a noble goal, but in practice it faces enormous obstacles. Both public and private institutions struggle with limited budgets, heavy bureaucracy, entrenched interests, and deep resistance to change. Reform efforts are often slow, superficial, fragmented, and easily
              disrupted by political cycles or funding cuts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if governments and traditional institutions had unlimited time and money, they would still struggle to align Education with the real needs of the job market and daily life. Free or subsidized Education has little value if graduates remain unprepared to survive and thrive in the real world. Without
              aligned incentives, educators and learners stay disconnected.
            </p>

            <p>
              MentorGuilds close this gap by directly aligning the interests of educators and learners, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that rewards real-world success.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over time, governments may choose to integrate with MentorGuilds —by funding tuition for high-risk mentees (such as ex-convicts) or allowing students to redirect existing public Education budgets toward the MentorGuild of their choice. These contributions would reduce the risks MentorGuilds take, enabling
              them to lower repayment factors (income percentage and total work hours) while keeping incentives properly aligned.
            </p>

            <p>
              The open data required of MentorGuilds will also help policymakers design smarter Education, workforce, and investment strategies—guided by real, transparent results.
            </p>

          <h1>The Power of Aligned Incentives for Work and Life</h1>
          <div>
            <p>
              MentorGuilds are designed to deliver high-quality education and personalized support, tailored to the specific needs and abilities of each mentee. Their goal is not only to provide better education than traditional systems but also to offer <b>continuous and real-world guidance</b> that connects both
              <b>work and life</b>.
              In a fast-changing world, where professional and personal challenges often overlap, this holistic approach is essential. Over time, it has the potential to transform not only individual lives but entire societies.
            </p>

            <p>
              The reason for this broad range of support is simple: anything that harms a mentee’s work quality or productivity will also harm the MentorGuild’s income and reputation — especially under the open data requirement. That is why successful MentorGuilds will adopt a holistic approach to their mentees’
              well-being, offering guidance and resources that extend far beyond traditional job training. In essence, the most effective MentorGuilds will teach not only work skills, but life skills.
            </p>

            <p>However, all this guidance remains optional. Mentees are free to make their own choices. MentorGuilds can advise — but never control.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Work Education and Support:</b>
                <ul>

          <h1>Risks</h1>
          <div>
            <p>While MentorGuilds promise major benefits for both mentees and society, they also carry real risks. Without proper safeguards, a MentorGuild could drift toward exploitation—becoming predatory, manipulative, or overly controlling.</p>
            <p>MentorGuilds have no authority over their mentees’ personal or professional decisions. They can only advise, not command. Their influence relies entirely on trust, credibility, and earned respect—on soft power rather than control.</p>
            <p>To prevent abuse, the model includes a robust framework of checks and balances, described in detail in the book. Mentees are granted clear rights and protections. Governments retain oversight mechanisms. And MentorGuilds operate under strict limits, facing firm penalties for any form of misconduct.</p>

          <h1>Alternatives to Funding Education</h1>
          <div>
            <p>At first glance, MentorGuilds may appear to be just another way to finance education — an alternative to free or subsidized programs, student loans, or income-based repayment models.</p>
            <p>But funding education is only one of the MentorGuild's objectives.</p>
            <p>Even when financing is the main focus, MentorGuilds can offer complementary roles. In highly regulated professions such as medicine, a MentorGuild’s primary role might be to finance a university degree. Yet their contribution does not end there. They can also provide stipends so students can study without the strain of part-time jobs, and continue supporting them after graduation — helping them find work, negotiate contracts, or navigate early career challenges.</p>

            <p>Although MentorGuilds may seem similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_share_agreement" target="ISAs">Income Sharing Agreements (ISAs)</a> or <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/dtc-finance-toolkit-factsheets/income-contingent-loans-icls" target="ICLs">Income Contingent Loans (ICLs)</a>
              — since all involve sharing a portion of future income in exchange for education — the resemblance is only superficial.</p>

            <p>Let us now examine the key differences between MentorGuilds and Education funding models. There are always exceptions, but in general:</p>

            <p>In essence, if a potential student finds a traditional education provider that fully meets their needs—free of <a href="#the-core-flaws-of-the-traditional-education-system">major flaws</a>—and does not need support or guidance beyond the classroom, then free or subsidized education, student loans, ISAs,
              or ICLs may be all that is needed.</p>

            <p>For everyone else, MentorGuilds provide added value: Education and repayments built on shared incentives, curated learning paths, and mentorship that continues long after graduation.</p>

          <h1>Key Concept: Education</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Many define Education as the simple acquisition of knowledge. But knowledge alone is far from enough to survive—let alone thrive—in work or in life.
            </p>

            <p>Education, in its ideal state, is the process by which individuals or entities (like groups, companies, governments, society) acquire <b>knowledge, skills, social capital, and meta-Education</b>; with the purpose to not only survive but thrive in the marketplace or life in general.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Knowledge:</b> the theoretical understanding of various subjects including foundational concepts, technologies, tools, methodologies, best practices, mental models, historical context, customers, regulations, traditions, and trends.</li>
              <li><b>Skills:</b> the practical application of knowledge to perform tasks efficiently and quickly. This is knowledge put into action. Skills include both those specific to one’s field and general abilities such as matching the right knowledge to a real-world problem, digital literacy, negotiation, time
                management, prioritizing, decision making, and problem-solving.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The next two areas also involve knowledge and skills in large parts, but they are important enough to deserve their own categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Social capital:</b> the web of relationships and skills that build trust and reputation—both among peers and with strangers. It is essential for creating strong networks and navigating social environments effectively. Social capital can be grouped into three key areas:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Self:</b> Skills applied to oneself, including active listening, effective communication, reading nonverbal cues, public speaking, offering help without being exploited, cultural sensitivity, social etiquette, conversation skills, conflict resolution, recognizing psychological issues in oneself
                    and others, political awareness, self-branding and marketing, and knowing how to build, maintain, and leverage contacts.</li>
                  <li><b>Indirect contacts:</b>following and learning from experts and thought leaders through social media, books, videos, podcasts, workshops, and conventions—while also understanding their strengths and limitations.</li>
                  <li><b>Direct contacts:</b> relationships with others in the field, from junior colleagues to senior professionals, as well as with clients, employers, stakeholders, mentors, and influential specialists. These connections allow for the exchange of advice, knowledge, and support, fostering mutual
                    growth and opportunity.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b>Meta-Education:</b> The art of learning. It covers effective learning techniques, staying motivated for continuous learning, and distinguishing between good and bad Education. It also includes developing self-awareness (knowing your own strengths and weaknesses), self-care, emotional intelligence,
                adaptability, critical thinking, and creativity.</li>
            </ul>
