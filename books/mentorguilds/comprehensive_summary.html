          <h1>Intro</h1>
          <div>
            <p>The lack of quality Education traps struggling populations, locking them out of good jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities. It creates a vicious circle where families without access to proper Education cannot provide it to their children, deepening inequality with each generation.</p>
            <p>As technology and society race ahead, the traditional Education system crawls behind. The result is a widening gap between what the world demands and what graduates can actually do.</p>

          <h1>Key Concept: Education</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Many define Education as the simple acquisition of knowledge. But knowledge alone is far from enough to survive—let alone thrive—in work or in life.
            </p>

            <p>Education, in its ideal state, is the process by which individuals or entities (like groups, companies, governments, society) acquire <b>knowledge, skills, social capital, and meta-Education</b>; with the purpose to not only survive but thrive in the marketplace or life in general.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Knowledge:</b> the theoretical understanding of various subjects including foundational concepts, technologies, tools, methodologies, best practices, mental models, historical context, customers, regulations, traditions, and trends.</li>
              <li><b>Skills:</b> the practical application of knowledge to perform tasks efficiently and quickly. This is knowledge put into action. Skills include both those specific to one’s field and general abilities such as matching the right knowledge to a real-world problem, digital literacy, negotiation, time
                management, prioritizing, decision making, and problem-solving.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The next two areas also involve knowledge and skills in large parts, but they are important enough to deserve their own categories:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Social capital:</b> the web of relationships and skills that build trust and reputation—both among peers and with strangers. It is essential for creating strong networks and navigating social environments effectively. Social capital can be grouped into three key areas:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Self:</b> Skills applied to oneself, including active listening, effective communication, reading nonverbal cues, public speaking, offering help without being exploited, cultural sensitivity, social etiquette, conversation skills, conflict resolution, recognizing psychological issues in oneself
                    and others, political awareness, self-branding and marketing, and knowing how to build, maintain, and leverage contacts.</li>
                  <li><b>Indirect contacts:</b>following and learning from experts and thought leaders through social media, books, videos, podcasts, workshops, and conventions—while also understanding their strengths and limitations.</li>
                  <li><b>Direct contacts:</b> relationships with others in the field, from junior colleagues to senior professionals, as well as with clients, employers, stakeholders, mentors, and influential specialists. These connections allow for the exchange of advice, knowledge, and support, fostering mutual
                    growth and opportunity.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><b>Meta-Education:</b> The art of learning. It covers effective learning techniques, staying motivated for continuous learning, and distinguishing between good and bad Education. It also includes developing self-awareness (knowing your own strengths and weaknesses), self-care, emotional intelligence,
                adaptability, critical thinking, and creativity.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h1>The Core Flaws of Traditional Education System</h1>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Trampled Students:</b> The system marches forward even when some fall behind, leaving lasting psychological scars.</li>
              <li><b>Missing Essentials:</b> Many critical skills are missing, leaving graduates unprepared for work and life.</li>
              <li><b>Wasteful:</b> Courses are cluttered with outdated content and methods, kept alive by tradition or decisions by committee rather than relevance.</li>
              <li><b>Misleading Prospects:</b> Students are often misled about salaries, career paths and job realities.</li>
              <li><b>Untimely:</b> Even valuable lessons arrive too early or too late—like teaching management to those who have never held a job.</li>
              <li><b>Inadequate Assessment:</b> Tests and grades rarely reflect the skills needed in real life or the job market.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Other problems—such as high tuition fees and student debt—are symptoms of these deeper flaws. Wasteful programs and false promises make inflated prices easier to justify, while curriculums that omit essential skills lead to poor job prospects, leaving graduates unable to repay the cost of their
              Education.</p>

            <p>These issues affect both private institutions, funded directly through tuition, and public institutions, funded indirectly through taxpayers.</p>

          <h1>The Root Cause: Misaligned Incentives</h1>
          <div>
            <p>
              When graduates struggle, educators face no penalty. When they succeed—even becoming billionaires—educators gain nothing. With no stake in their students’ long-term outcomes, institutions have little motivation to deliver Education that truly works.
            </p>

            <p>
              By the time graduates face real-world challenges, traditional institutions have already laughed all the way to the bank, having been paid—whether through tuition or taxpayer funding. They have no skin in the game.
            </p>

            <p>
              The root cause of the problem is simple: misaligned incentives between educators and students.

          <h1>MentorGuilds: The Solution</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds are our proposed novel/unique/single-purpose legal organization, designed to align the incentives of educators (mentors) and students (mentees).</p>

            <article>
              <h2>Funding Model</h2>
              <p>MentorGuilds can only make money from their mentees, and only in two ways:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Most of their income will come from a share of their mentees’ future income, after tax, paid only for hours worked in jobs that use the skills the MentorGuild helped provide.</li>
                <li>A smaller part of their income can come from optional tuition paid by the mentees</li>
              </ol>

              <p>There is no interest, predatory fine print, debt, fees, or penalties of any kind. No compounding balances, fixed repayment schedules, third-party collections, credit reporting, or arbitrary deadlines for completing education</p>
              <p>mentees never owe money unless they earn it. If they never find a job, or choose to leave the field they trained for, they owe nothing</p>


              <p>When mentees succeed, MentorGuilds prosper. When mentees fail, both lose. This shared fate and long term relationships keep MentorGuilds accountable to real-world results, not empty promises or outdated practices.</p>

              <p>This gives MentorGuilds a strong incentive to assess whether potential mentees are truly suited for their chosen industry—and to ensure they can remain
                happy and productive there for the long term.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
              <h2>Open Data Requirement</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Every mentee’s complete contract and regularly updated work hours/income will forever be publicly available online.</p>

                <p>This level of transparency will give journalists, researchers, potential mentees, governments, investors, entrepreneurs, competitors, industry participants and the general population a clear view of which skills, industries, and MentorGuilds are thriving and which are falling behind. It will send
                  strong signals that drive smarter, more efficient economic
                  choices.</p>
                <p>It will also make many types of abuse hard to hide. Exploitative workloads or suspiciously inflated incomes will stand out in plain sight. The goal is simple: to make MentorGuilds the most transparent and publicly scrutinized institutions in society.</p>

          <h1>A Better Model: MentorGuilds</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds are our proposed novel/unique/single-purpose legal organization, designed to align the incentives of educators (mentors) and students (mentees).</p>

            <p>
              Its first core feature is the funding model. MentorGuilds earn most of their income not from tuition, but from a share of their mentees’ future earnings—paid only for hours worked in jobs that use the skills the MentorGuild helped provide.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example: a mentee might agree to contribute <b>5.1% of their income</b> for the next <b>9,200 relevant work hours</b>.
            </p>

            <p>When mentees succeed, MentorGuilds prosper. When mentees fail, both lose. This shared fate and long term relationships keep MentorGuilds accountable to real-world results, not empty promises or outdated practices.</p>

            <p>Most importantly, mentees never owe money unless they earn it. If they never find a job, or choose to leave the field they trained for, they owe nothing.</p>

            <p>This gives MentorGuilds a strong incentive to assess whether potential mentees are truly suited for their chosen industry—and to ensure they can remain
              happy and productive there for the long term.</p>

            <p>There is no interest, predatory fine print, debt, fees, or penalties of any kind. No compounding balances, fixed repayment schedules, third-party collections, credit reporting, or arbitrary deadlines for completing education.</p>

            <p>
              MentorGuilds keep things simple: the only financial obligation a mentee has is a share of their future income—paid only if and when they earn it—and any agreed tuition.
            </p>

            <p>
              The name <b>MentorGuild</b> was chosen to reflect two likely key roles they will play:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Mentor:</b> Emphasizing the personalized guidance and support offered to each mentee, tailored to their unique needs and goals. The aim is to help mentees become as self-reliant as possible. Unlike teachers, who deliver skills directly, mentors often curate the best available education and fund
                their mentees’ access to top external instructors, complementing with their own internal materials when needed.</li>
              <li><b>Guild:</b> Representing the community-oriented spirit of the organization, where members collaborate, share knowledge, and support each other’s growth and success over time.</li>
            </ul>


            <p>MentorGuilds can be structured in many different ways, depending on their mission, context, and the needs of their mentees:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>They can operate as non-profits, cooperatives, or for-profit entities, depending on their goals and funding models.</li>
              <li>They may be small, specialized groups focused on niche skills or industries, or broad organizations teaching general skills such as coding, design, or marketing—useful across many fields.</li>
              <li>They can range from large organizations with thousands of mentors across multiple disciplines to individual mentors guiding just a few mentees.</li>
              <li>They may be local, community-based groups or global networks that use digital tools to connect mentors and mentees across borders.</li>
              <li>They can focus on traditional trades like carpentry, plumbing, or electrical work, or on emerging fields such as AI development, renewable energy, or biotechnology.</li>
              <li>They can target specific demographics—such as underrepresented groups, career changers, or lifelong learners—or simply anyone interested in their area of expertise.</li>
              <li>They may offer flexible, modular learning paths tailored to each mentee’s goals, or provide structured, long-form programs similar to traditional education when appropriate.</li>
              <li>They can embrace modern technologies like AI, VR, and e-learning platforms, or adopt a fully offline approach built on in-person mentorship and hands-on training.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The freedom to quickly adapt to changing circumstances and the unique needs of each mentee is a key advantage of the MentorGuild model.</p>

            <article>
              <h2>Hours, Not Years or Money</h2>
              <div>
                <p>
                  Repayment is tied to hours worked, not to fixed time limits or total financial amounts. A mentee may fulfill their commitment quickly or gradually over a lifetime. This structure gives MentorGuilds a powerful incentive to keep their mentees sustainably productive—protecting them from burnout,
                  depression, unpaid labor, or toxic workplaces.
                </p>

                <p>
                  MentorGuilds are motivated to promote balance: encouraging rest, continued learning, and even sabbaticals that reignite passion and performance. Their goal is simple—to help mentees work at their best, not just work the most.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This approach transforms Education from a one-time transaction into a lifelong partnership for growth and sustainability.

            <article>
              <h2>Influence Without Authority</h2>
              <div>
                <p>MentorGuilds cannot control their mentees’ personal or professional choices. They can only advise and hope their guidance is respected. Their influence depends entirely on trust and earned respect—on soft power, not control.</p>
                <p>MentorGuilds are free to experiment. They can use different methods, technologies, and rhythms of learning. </p>
              </div>
            </article>

            <article>
              <h2>The Power of Open Data</h2>
              <div>
                <p>The second core feature of MentorGuilds is their <b>open data requirement</b>. It will provide strong safeguards for mentees, and many benefits for society.</p>
                <p>Every mentee’s complete contract and work/income will forever be publicly available online, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The full contract terms, with income percentage and total work hours, and any financial aid or tuition paid.</li>
                  <li>The skills delivered</li>
                  <li>Ongoing monthly updates of income and work hours</li>
                  <li>Mentee commentaries on their experience.</li>
                  <li>Any legal changes to the contract imposed by judges.</li>
                  <li>Mentee identification details are redacted/anonymized.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This level of transparency will give journalists, researchers, potential mentees, governments, investors, entrepreneurs, competitors, industry participants and the general population a clear view of which skills, industries, and MentorGuilds are thriving and which are falling behind. It will send
                  strong signals that drive smarter, more efficient economic
                  choices.</p>
                <p>It will also make many types of abuse hard to hide. Exploitative workloads or suspiciously inflated incomes will stand out in plain sight.</p>

                <p>
                  The goal is simple: to make MentorGuilds the most transparent and publicly scrutinized institutions in society.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Transparency will make society and markets smarter, fairer, and more efficient.

           <article>
          <h1>Profits</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Preliminary calculations suggest that MentorGuilds could be highly profitable. A contribution of roughly 5% of income over 9,200 relevant work hours — about five years of full-time employment—could yield profitability similar to that of many vocational trade schools and technology bootcamps.</p>

            <p>Beyond this baseline, several unique advantages can further enhance sustainability and profitability:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Efficient Mentoring: Mentoring is far less time-consuming than traditional teaching. MentorGuilds focus on curating the best available education and funding their mentees’ access to top external instructors, while supplementing those resources with their own internal materials when needed.</li>
              <li>Minimal Overhead: MentorGuilds do not require physical locations. They can operate entirely online, meeting mentees in person only when necessary and in public spaces. </li>
              <li>Economies of Scale:
                <ul>
                  <li>Shared tools, platforms, and learning resources that benefit all mentees.</li>
                  <li>Community networks where mentees support each other within small pods or entire community.</li>
                  <li>A centralized and growing online platform, where communication can happen asynchronously, allowing mentees/mentors to connect and collaborate on their own schedules, having common questions answered, and opportunities for AI to assist.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>We also <strong>strongly encourage</strong> two policy measures that would drastically reduce administrative and compliance costs, making MentorGuilds fairer, more sustainable, and more scalable:</p>
            <article>
              <h2>1. Tax Exemption</h2>
              <div>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Avoiding double taxation:</b> The income has already been taxed at the individual level. A tax exemption aligns with how other pass-through income arrangements (like trusts or family transfers) are treated.</li>
                  <li><b>Encouraging education:</b> Education is a strategic national priority; exempting MentorGuilds supports this mission.</li>
                  <li><b>Enhancing market efficiency:</b> The open-data requirement provides valuable insights to society, making the entire economy more transparent and data-driven.</li>
                  <li><b>Balancing Operational Constraints:</b> Given their heavy transparency obligations, restrictions on other income sources and other strict rules, tax exemption would be a fair and necessary offset.</li>
                  <li><b>Global Competitiveness:</b> Countries that foster flexible, efficient, and results-oriented education alternatives will better equip their population for the future of work.</li>
                  <li><b>Precedent in Tax Benefits for Education-Linked Entities</b> Many countries already offer tax benefits to institutions linked to education or public service: nonprofit universities, apprenticeship programs, even employer-provided tuition reimbursement</li>
                  <li><b>Long Term raising of Taxes:</b> By raising the income of their mentees and encouraging them to open companies, MentorGuilds will raise tax revenue in the long run.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </article>

            <article>
              <h2>2. Mentors as Legal Partners</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Mentors should be legally recognized as partners within the MentorGuild model. This reflects their hybrid role as collaborators, educators, and investors in their mentees’ success.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Part-time professionals:</b> most mentors will likely be active in their industries, bringing current skills, insider knowledge, and real-world connections to their mentees. The partner structure allows for flexibility without requiring full-time roles.</li>
                  <li><b>No employment overhead:</b> As partners (similar to law firms or consultancies), mentors are not employees. They are self-employed, managing their own schedules and workloads. This removes the need for traditional employee benefits such as health insurance, paid leave, retirement contributions,
                    or workers’ compensation—especially when interactions are largely online and low-risk.</li>
                  <li><b>Aligned incentives:</b> Instead of fixed salaries or hourly rates, mentors earn a share of repayments or tuition collected from their mentees, ensuring their income reflects real outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </article>

            <p>
              Beyond financial returns, MentorGuilds and their mentors gain early access to emerging trends in technology, markets, and culture; build strong professional networks; gather high-quality industry data; and gain reputation, media exposure, and the opportunity to advise governments and participate in public
              debate—all while experiencing the deep satisfaction of helping others succeed.
            </p>

            <p>A simple rule of thumb, is that a thriving mentor should be able to make their mentees earn the same salary as themselves, on average.
              If we assume a percentage share of around 5%, which is what many students consider reasonable, they woduld need to menter 10 mentees to generate half of their own salary.
              A very achieavable goal for a part-time mentor in most professions, not requiring too many hours per week.

              That means the maths looks like: mentor income = percentage share x mentee income x number of mentees.
            </p>

            <p>
              With low operating costs, scalable online delivery, and incentives tied directly to mentee success, MentorGuilds have the potential to generate significant long-term returns for founders, investors, and mentors alike.

          <h1>MentorGuild Roles for Mentees</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Over time, MentorGuilds may adopt multiple roles to better serve their mentees—even roles that extend beyond work related Education.</p>

            <p>By helping individuals thrive, MentorGuilds also serve the greater good.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Launchpads for Educational Innovation:</b> Their freedom to experiment will create new forms of Education.</li>
              <li><b>Economic Bridge Between Social Classes:</b> Successful professionals will have incentives to mentor the underprivileged, spreading opportunity where it is needed most.</li>
              <li><b>Healing Multi-Generational Habits and Traumas:</b> By addressing trauma and self-sabotage, MentorGuilds can break negative cycles that echo through families and communities.</li>
              <li><b>Solving Localized Problems:</b> They can specialize—training tradespeople in underserved areas or helping ex-convicts reintegrate into society.</li>
              <li><b>Basic research:</b> Over time, MentorGuilds may sponsor basic research to gain a competitive edge.</li>
              <li><b>Refugees and Local Mentors:</b> Local mentors can guide newcomers through laws, culture and job markets.</li>

              <li><b>Flighting Regulatory Capture:</b> MentorGuilds could be incentivized to dismantle regulatory capture of industries or regions, as this could provide more opportunities for their mentees.</li>
              <li><b>Incentives for Innovation in a Patentless Economy:</b> Without patents, MentorGuilds would promote innovation to benefit their mentees — creating results through shared success rather than monopolies.</li>

          <h1>The Power of Aligned Incentives for Work and Life</h1>
          <div>
            <p>
              MentorGuilds are designed to deliver high-quality education and personalized support, tailored to the specific needs and abilities of each mentee. Their goal is not only to provide better education than traditional systems but also to offer <b>continuous and real-world guidance</b> that connects both <b>work and life</b>.
              In a fast-changing world, where professional and personal challenges often overlap, this holistic approach is essential. Over time, it has the potential to transform not only individual lives but entire societies.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Work:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>Helping mentees find job opportunities that match their skills, aspirations, and personal constraints (such as location, caregiving duties, or preferred industries).</li>
                  <li>Guiding mentees through workplace dynamics—dealing with difficult colleagues, understanding office politics, and learning when to speak up or seek allies.</li>
                  <li>Assisting with salary, promotion, and contract negotiations, especially for those unfamiliar with professional norms in their industry or region.</li>
                  <li>Advising mentees on the best location where their profession is in demand, and taxes are favorable.</li>
                  <li>Encouraging the ongoing development of technical and interpersonal skills to stay competitive in a market reshaped by AI, automation, and global change.</li>
                  <li>Protecting mentees from exploitative practices such as unpaid work, long shifts, unrealistic promises, coercive NDAs, or illegal job conditions.</li>
                  <li>Promoting smart career moves—like industry changes, upskilling, or strategic lateral roles that build long-term value.</li>
                  <li>Empower mentees to start their own businesses, secure funding, and grow their enterprises.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li><b>Life:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Mental health:</b> Teaching coping strategies, helping mentees spot early signs of burnout, and connecting them with professional help when needed.</li>
                  <li><b>Physical health:</b> Promoting healthy routines for sleep, posture, diet, and exercise—especially for those in high-stress or sedentary jobs.</li>
                  <li><b>Relationships:</b> Helping mentees build and maintain respectful friendships, partnerships, and professional networks—both online and offline.</li>
                  <li><b>Work-life balance:</b> Supporting thoughtful tradeoffs (like income versus flexibility), managing conflicting priorities, and establishing clear boundaries.</li>
                  <li><b>Financial literacy:</b> Teaching mentees how to budget, invest, compare job offers beyond salary (such as benefits or equity), understand taxes, and avoid scams or debt traps.</li>
                  <li><b>Major life transitions:</b> Offering guidance through big changes such as moving cities, switching careers, starting a family, or facing health challenges.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The logic behind this wide range of support is simple: anything that harms a mentee’s productivity or well-being also harms the MentorGuild’s results. Because income and reputation depend on transparent outcomes, MentorGuilds are motivated to invest in their mentees’ overall health and growth. The most effective MentorGuilds will not only teach people how to work, but how to live well.

          <h1>MentorGuilds Risks</h1>
          <div>
            <p>While MentorGuilds offer major benefits to both mentees and society, they also carry real risks. MentorGuilds could go wrong if left unchecked—becoming predatory, manipulative, or controlling.</p>
            <p>To prevent such outcomes, the model includes a strong framework of checks and balances, detailed extensively in the book. Mentees are granted clear rights and protections, governments have oversight mechanisms, and MentorGuilds operate under strict limits with firm penalties for misconduct.</p>

          <h1>Why not Improve Traditional Education?</h1>
          <div>
            <p>
              Must we really “sell” part of our future income to receive an Education? Education is a human right. Shouldn’t governments provide it for free or heavily subsidize it? Shouldn’t society focus on improving the quality of the institutions we already have?
            </p>
            <p>
              Improving traditional Education is a noble goal, but in practice it faces enormous obstacles. Both public and private institutions struggle with limited budgets, heavy bureaucracy, entrenched interests, and deep resistance to change. Reform efforts are often slow, superficial, fragmented, and easily
              disrupted by political cycles or funding cuts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if governments and traditional institutions had unlimited time and money, they would still struggle to align Education with the real needs of the job market and daily life. Free or subsidized Education has little value if graduates remain unprepared to survive and thrive in the real world. Without
              aligned incentives, educators and learners stay disconnected.
            </p>

            <p>
              MentorGuilds close this gap by directly aligning the interests of educators and learners, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that rewards real-world success.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over time, governments may choose to integrate with MentorGuilds —by funding tuition for high-risk mentees (such as ex-convicts) or allowing students to redirect existing public Education budgets toward the MentorGuild of their choice. These contributions would reduce the risks MentorGuilds take, enabling
              them to
              lower repayment factors (income percentage and total work hours) while keeping incentives properly aligned.
            </p>

            <p>
              The open data required of MentorGuilds will also help policymakers design smarter Education, workforce, and investment strategies—guided by real, transparent results.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <div>
            <p>MentorGuilds are organizations built to align the interests of individuals and educators. Their mission is to help people develop the skills they need to thrive—both at work and in life. They are not rigid, centrally planned systems tied to fixed teaching methods, but launchpads for Educational
              innovation and rapid adaptation, evolving alongside their mentees and a constantly changing world.</p>

            <p>Through aligned incentives, transparency, and strict organizational rules, MentorGuilds are can be a major contributor to close the growing gap between the skills society needs and the skills people currently have.</p>

          <h1>First-Generation MentorGuilds: Low-Hanging Fruits</h1>
          <div>
            <p>This is a fictional example of how a MentorGuild might operate in practice.</p>
            <p>In the early stages, the first generation of MentorGuilds are likely to focus on simple, high-certainty opportunities—what might be called low-hanging fruit. These are individuals who already show promise: they are talented, disciplined, and may have taken early steps toward a career but remain blocked
              due to lack of guidance or difficult life circumstances.</p>
            <p>Karla and Jane are senior software developers with decades of experience. Their talks are available online, and their blog posts are widely read. They have heard about the rise of MentorGuilds—an idea gaining traction—but notice that most existing ones are gender-neutral and miss a chance to focus on
              underrepresented groups.</p>
            <p>Having long encouraged young women to explore software development, Karla and Jane decide to take that mission further by launching their own MentorGuild: their brand new <b>“Girls Who Code MentorGuild”</b>.</p>
            <p>They begin by offering a free coding workshop / recruiting session in a low-income neighborhood, specifically for young women. To qualify, attendees must first watch three of their one-hour online videos covering the basics. This small requirement helps filter for commitment while ensuring all
              participants arrive with a shared foundation.</p>
            <p>This simple initiative marks the beginning of their MentorGuild journey—targeting a group with untapped potential and high payoff, both socially and economically.</p>
            <p>Many attendees show up for their workshop, but it quickly becomes clear—through their questions and comments—that most have not completed the required pre-course videos. One young woman stands out: <b>Bea</b>. She asks thoughtful, relevant questions that reveal she did the preparation and is eager to
              learn, even without prior experience in coding.</p>
            <p>Bea is the oldest of two sisters. Her father left the family when she was young, and her mother has held the family together ever since, running a small food stall in the local market. The family lives in a cramped apartment, surviving on a modest income.</p>
            <p>Now that Bea has finished high school, her mother is hoping she will join the food stall business and help it grow. Bea, however, is more interested in technology and software. She understands that the IT industry offers higher earning potential and long-term career opportunities, but her family cannot
              afford university or specialized training.</p>
            <p>Karla and Jane offer to take Bea on as their first official mentee. Bea is excited—but hesitant, as MentorGuilds are a new thing. She explains she needs to talk with her mother before making a decision.</p>
            <p>The next day, Bea returns with bad news: her mother needs her help at the food stall immediately. She cannot afford to spend a long time without contributing income to the family.</p>
            <p>Karla and Jane ask if they can speak directly with her mother at their home. A few days later, the four of them sit down together. Karla and Jane explain Bea’s potential. They believe that with her curiosity, work ethic, and intelligence, she could land an entry-level developer job with as little as one
              year of focused study. But Bea’s mother insists that they do not have a year—she needs her daughter’s help now.</p>
            <p>Karla asks how much income Bea would likely generate at the food stall in the coming year. The amount is modest—far less than a junior developer’s starting salary. Karla and Jane step aside and discuss whether their planned one-year Education program could be compressed. They decide that with an
              intensive focus, they can give Bea the minimum essentials in three months—just enough to help her secure her first coding job. The rest of her Education can be delivered later.</p>
            <p>Bea is thrilled. Her mother remains cautious. She is skeptical of MentorGuilds and unsure that such short period of Education can lead to real employment.</p>
            <p>Jane addresses her concerns directly. Even in the worst-case scenario, she explains, Bea will gain valuable digital skills—skills that can be used in the family business, from creating a website to designing banners or managing inventory software. If Bea doesn’t get a job in the industry, and ends up
              working at the stall anyway, she owes nothing to
            <p>Over the following weeks, Bea works hard on learning programming, but also many other subjects.</p>
            <p>She learns how to work with a mentor—how to use their time wisely, how to ask for feedback, when to take initiative, and how to stretch herself between sessions. Karla and Jane introduce her to real-world job positions and walk through their job descriptions line by line, explaining what each requirement
              means and what level of skill she needs to reach.</p>
            <p>A few weeks before the three-month mark, they encourage Bea to start applying for jobs, even if she feels unprepared. It is not just about landing a role—it is about learning important skills such as interviewing, self-presentation, and handling rejection. Bea admits she feels unqualified. Karla and Jane
              explain the concept of impostor syndrome, reassuring her that confidence grows through action. They help her craft a solid résumé, conduct mock interviews, and debrief after each real interview to capture lessons learned.</p>
            <p>Just before the three-month deadline, Bea receives a job offer from a small startup—just the founder and a few employees. The salary matches what she would have made working full-time at her mother’s food stall, but with far more growth potential. The founder even hints at future promotions as the
              company expands.</p>
            <p>During the final interview, the founder asks if Bea is affiliated with a MentorGuild. As coached by her mentors, she says no. While this may seem ethically murky, it is fully supported by MentorGuild law, to protect mentees from the social skepticism toward unconventional Educational paths—a reality
              Karla and Jane prepared her for.</p>
            <p>Bea shares the offer and job contract with her mentors for review. After discussions, they all agree: this is a strong first step. Bea accepts the position.</p>
            <p>Bea begins her new job with enthusiasm—and quickly thrives. Both she and her mother are thrilled. Bea is contributing to the family finances while working in a field she is passionate about. She is paid to learn (<b>experiential Education</b>), grow, and explore a career with long-term potential.</p>
            <p>She throws herself into the job, practicing technical skills, observing how IT companies function, and absorbing everything from data security to project management. She builds social capital with her colleagues, volunteers for extra tasks, and pays close attention to workflows and team dynamics.</p>
            <p>She also works long hours—not out of obligation, but because she is learning and engaged. Most days, she checks in with her mentors to discuss what she is learning, explore new resources, and identify areas to improve. They assign additional homework to strengthen her foundation and keep pushing her
              development forward.</p>
            <p>Her manager notices her. Impressed with Bea’s initiative and reliability, he assigns her more responsibilities. As her value to the company increases, so does her confidence—and her mother’s. The decision to join a MentorGuild appears to be paying off. The income is steady, her employer is supportive,
              and her Education (both formal from the MentorGuild-provided courses, and experiential from the job) continues.</p>
            <p>With guidance from the MentorGuild, Bea regularly updates her online portfolio and public profile. As a result, headhunters begin to notice. She starts receiving inquiries and job offers. For the first time, her family’s financial future feels not only stable but hopeful.</p>
            <p>But after six months, a new pattern emerges. Bea is now spending more of her time on repetitive, low-growth tasks, often during unpaid overtime. Her manager assigns her these tasks because he trusts her—and because she delivers. But the learning curve is flattening.</p>
            <p>Bea remains upbeat. She tells her mentors she is still excited about the job. She feels valued, respected, and secure. Financially, she is doing better than she ever imagined at this point in her life.</p>
            <p>But the MentorGuild sees early warning signs.</p>
            <p>First, Bea’s unpaid overtime is being deducted from her contractual worked hours—without generating any corresponding income. This reduces the MentorGuild’s income and public profile while offering limited benefits to Bea. Second, her experiential Education has begun to plateau. The daily challenges that
              once pushed her to grow have faded, replaced by routine and predictability. Her boss says he is sorry and promises to give her tasks more aligned with her talent, but nothing changes.</p>
            <p>While Bea still feels satisfied and valued, the MentorGuild gently suggests that she consider aiming higher. Her current role may feel safe and familiar, but it no longer stretches her abilities or develops new skills. What was once a perfect fit may now be holding her back.</p>
            <p>The MentorGuild’s role is not to pressure but to guide. Their concern is not just about lost income—it is about potential left untapped. The question now is whether Bea will remain in her job or seek her next stage of growth.</p>
