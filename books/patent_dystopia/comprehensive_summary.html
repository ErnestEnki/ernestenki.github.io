          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Humanity faces a multitude of challenges, including climate change, economic bubbles and inequality, poor
              Education , addictions, and many more. But what if the root cause, the hidden constraint, lies not in
              individual problems, but in the very system that is supposed to encourage progress?</p>

            <p>This book argues that the patent system - the fundamental principles used by patent laws in every country
              -
              while often viewed as a driver of innovation, has instead become a noose around humanity's neck. It
              strangles
              job creation, prevents competition, widens inequality, reduces true innovation, and disrupts the natural
              flow
              of capitalism.</p>

            <p>At first glance, the patent system may seem like a niche topic, but we will explore how it impacts all
              aspects of society, from cutting-edge technologies to issues that affect our everyday lives, such as the
              price
              of tomatoes at the supermarket, the struggles of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), access to
              medicine, and even the broader challenges of Education and national development.</p>

            <p>While patents may seem like a terribly dry and boring topic, and perhaps a little intimidating, this book skips the irrelevant
              technicalities
              and keeps the story engaging and relevant to the average person.</p>

            <p>You will learn interesting stories and answers to some of today’s most pressing mysteries, such as:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Why worker bargaining power and purchasing power are shrinking while inflation rises</li>
              <li>Why we work long hours despite technological advances</li>
              <li>The "productivity paradox," which began in the 1970s</li>
              <li>What all nations that have achieved developed status have in common, including the United States (US),
                Britain, Japan, South Korea, and now the People’s Republic of China (China)</li>
              <li>Why most developing countries struggle to escape poverty</li>
              <li>The unparalleled innovation and good quality in the software industry, compared with other sectors
              </li>
              <li>Why Hollywood became the global center for filmmaking</li>
              <li>What the patent system was originally designed for</li>
              <li>Why companies can get away with planned obsolescence of goods, shelving useful inventions or making
                their
                products impossible to repair</li>
              <li>Why the belief that patents can protect small inventors is a myth, the David vs Goliath fallacy</li>
              <li>How the computer revolution actually started</li>
              <li>Why industries driven by trends, like fashion and interior design, employ so many people</li>
              <li>How the Soviet Union was unexpectedly competitive during the space race</li>
              <li>How NASA caught up with the Soviet Union in the space race</li>
              <li>The rise in inequality in many countries following the fall of the Soviet Union</li>
              <li>Why baby boomers rule many countries, even though they are a minority</li>
              <li>Why neoliberal policies in the 90s failed to create competition, leading to markets dominated by
                oligopolies</li>
              <li>The unique success of Israel in replicating Silicon Valley sustainably</li>
              <li>The role of war in reducing inequality</li>
              <li>Why we are stuck in cycles of economic booms and busts</li>
              <li>The phenomenon of "secular stagnation"</li>
              <li>The real reason why deflation is a problem</li>
              <li>How to achieve prosperity and increasing living standards without economic growth</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This book is for everyone. Whether you are a seasoned economist, a policymaker driven by humanitarian
              goals,
              an interested citizen, or simply a curious high schooler, these pages offer a compelling case for
              rethinking
              humankind’s recent history and the very foundation of innovation.</p>

            <p>It is an invitation to embrace a bright future in which progress flows freely, unconstrained by the
              shackles
              of a system whose time is past.</p>

          <h1>Root causes</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Humanity faces numerous challenges, including climate change, loss of biodiversity, environmental
              disasters, lost middle-class jobs, unemployment, underemployment, job insecurity, overwork, escapism
              (through addictions or superstition), a mental health crisis, an underground economy, the financialization
              of the economy, a decline in civic participation, debt, inflation, and many others.</p>

            <p>However, we can trace the root causes of these diverse problems to two key factors that heavily
              contribute
              to all of them: the lack of jobs and inadequate Education.</p>

            <article class="alert alert-primary">
              <h1>Key Concept: Education</h1>
              <div>
                <p>Many define Education as merely the acquisition of knowledge, but that alone is far from enough to
                  thrive.
                </p>

                <p>Education, in its ideal state, is the process by which individuals or entities (like groups,
                  companies,
                  governments, society) acquire <b>knowledge, skills, social capital, and meta-Education</b>; with the
                  purpose
                  to not only survive but thrive in the marketplace or life in general.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><b>Knowledge:</b> the theoretical understanding of various subjects including foundational
                    concepts,
                    technologies, tools, methodologies, best practices, economic factors, historical context, customers,
                    regulations, traditions, and trends. </li>
                  <li><b>Skills:</b> the practical application of knowledge to perform tasks efficiently and quickly.
                    This
                    is knowledge put into action. Skills include both those specific to one’s field and general
                    abilities
                    such as matching the right knowledge to a real-world problem, digital literacy, negotiation, time
                    management, prioritizing, decision making, and problem-solving.</li>
                  <li><b>Social capital:</b> the relationships that foster trust and credibility, among both peers and
                    strangers.
                    It is essential for building strong networks and navigating social environments effectively. There
                    are
                    three
                    key types of social capital:
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Self:</b> personal social knowledge and skills, such as active listening, effective
                        communication, reading nonverbal cues, public speaking, helpfulness (while avoiding
                        exploitation),
                        cultural sensitivity, social etiquette, conflict resolution, the ability to recognize
                        psychological
                        issues in oneself and others, and knowing how to build and maintain meaningful connections.</li>
                      <li><b>Indirect contacts:</b> which experts and thought leaders to follow and learn from via
                        channels
                        such
                        as social media, books, videos, podcasts, workshops and conventions.</li>
                      <li><b>Direct contacts:</b> direct relationships with others in the field, from junior colleagues
                        to
                        senior
                        professionals, allowing for the exchange of advice, knowledge, and support, thereby fostering
                        mutual
                        growth and opportunity.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Meta-Education:</b> The art of learning. It covers effective learning techniques, staying
                    motivated
                    for
                    continuous learning, and distinguishing between good and bad Education (knowledge, skills, or social
                    contacts like experts and colleagues). It also includes developing self-awareness (knowing your own
                    strengths and weaknesses), self-care, emotional
                    intelligence, adaptability, critical thinking, and creativity.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </article>

            <p>Lack of jobs makes it hard for individuals to care for themselves, their family, their community, the
              enviromment or society in general. The result is often shortcuts by individuals and socities, such as fake
              prosperity, debt, escapism, etc.</p>
            <p>Inadequate Education prevents us from filling the opportunities that do exist.</p>

            <p>Therefore, the primary objective of this book is to help solve the lack of jobs problem and, where
              possible, address inadequate Education, as the latter will be the sole focus of the next book.</p>

              <h1>What Creates or Destroys Tasks and Jobs?</h1>
              <div>

                <p>Let's try to understand what forces create or destroy jobs. These can be summarized in this diagram:

                <footer>Disclaimer: This diagram may be somewhat complex, but the reader does not need to remember every
                  detail or
                  even agree with every part. It is simply a reference to help visualize where the negative effects of
                  patents
                  come into play.</footer>

                  <h1>Key Concept: Innovation cycle</h1>
                  <div>

                    <img src="images/innovation_cycle.png" />

                    <p><b>Inventions</b> are new practical ideas, such as new products, methods of production, or
                      processes.
                      Before its implementation, each invention is a theoretical creation that exists in the mind of its
                      inventor,
                      on paper, or in computer files. </p>
                    <p>To avoid confusion, we adhere to the definition used by the US Patent and Trademark Office: “any
                      new
                      and
                      useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement
                      thereof.”
                    </p>


                    <p><b>Introduction</b> is the initial phase of an invention’s implementation, bringing it to the
                      real
                      world.
                      It can involve producing a new device or chemical, opening a factory, or teaching a new process to
                      staff
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Diffusion</b> is the spread of an invention throughout society. Introduction and Diffusion are
                      thus
                      the
                      two phases of implementation, bringing the invention into reality.
                    </p>

                    <p>The implementer’s identity is irrelevant: It could be the original inventor, a competitor,
                      tinkerer,
                      researcher, a patent licensee, a patent infringer, or anyone else.
                      <br />
                      What matters is the timing: The first phase of the implementation of a new invention is the
                      Introduction;
                      and when the invention spreads, which is the second phase, that is Diffusion.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Ideosphere</b> is where collective ideas reside, interact, and evolve. Here, a vast array of
                      concepts—from inventions to artistic creations—are stored, evaluated, connected, and shared.</p>

                    <p>Like the natural world's biosphere, the Ideosphere hosts a variety of ideas and solutions to
                      similar
                      problems, with many niches. It thus enables competition, for instance, among a variety of
                      Inventions for
                      energy storage in batteries or among different approaches to AI training.</p>

                    <p><b>Innovation Cycle</b>, or simply <b>Innovation</b>, is the process of producing or adopting and
                      then
                      exploiting a novelty in economic and social spheres. This includes new or changed products and
                      services,
                      methods of production, or management systems. Innovation is both a process and an outcome.</p>

                    <p>Each stage in the Innovation Cycle — Invention, Introduction, Diffusion, and the Ideosphere —
                      fuels
                      the
                      next, collectively driving innovation forward.

                        New
                        breakthroughs can lead to the creation of new markets and industries, and the necessity of old

                        needed to
                        address these challenges and simplify things. For example, hybrid vehicles require new

                  destruction work freely, which will allow Smalle and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to flourish.</p>

                <p>The prosperity of SMEs is a core objective of the book, because <a

                    contribute 60% of employment in OECD countries.</a></p>

                <p>The reason why the patent system is our main culprit can be found in the many problems that patents
                  creates:</p>

          <h1>Patent Problem #1: Subjectivity of Borders Between Ideas</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Patents assume there clear boundaries exist between distinct ideas such as inventions. In reality, ideas
              often overlap with what we would consider obvious, are inspired by previous inventions (prior art), and
              evolve over time, making it impossible to define precise boundaries. Different people—such as patent
              examiners, lawyers, and judges—often interpret a patent’s scope in wildly different ways.</p>
            <p>If we were to survey a thousand experts on whether an invention is obvious and how similar it is to other
              inventions, the results would show that all inventions share some degree of obviousness and overlap with
              others, and there are no black and white answers, like this graph:</p>
            <img src="images/ideas_overlap.png" />

            <p>Proof of this can be found in several areas:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Legal Cases:</b> Many patent cases reveal that even large, wealthy companies—despite consulting top
                patent lawyers to avoid infringement—are found liable for infringing on others’ patents. This
                demonstrates
                the inherent difficulty in drawing clear boundaries.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Economic and Intellectual Observations:</b> Economists and thinkers have noted that it is nearly
                impossible to separate different inventors' contributions, as ideas naturally overlap and build on one
                another. This observation challenges the notion of distinct, non-overlapping inventions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Insurance Market Trends:</b> There is a notable lack of a robust insurance market to protect
                companies
                from unintended patent infringement, whereas similar insurance policies for physical property (such as
                land) or for copyright infringement are common. This discrepancy indicates that the uncertainty
                surrounding patent scope is significantly higher.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>This pervasive subjectivity creates uncertainty around the scope of patents and the outcomes of potential
              litigation. As a result, large companies acquire vast numbers of patents, creating a portfolio of patents,
              hoping that some will withstand scrutiny. They also invest in large legal teams to defend their patent
              portfolio.</p>

            <p>Large companies hold a significant advantage over SMEs because they have more money, staff, time, and
              experience to mitigate the risks created by the subjectivity in the patent system.</p>
            <p>These large companies use this undeserved and disproportionate power to drive competing SMEs out of
              business through accusations of patent infringement. Often, this occurs behind closed doors during
              negotiations, but at times such abuses become public knowledge.</p>

            <p>Even the mere threat or rumors of a patent lawsuit from a larger company can be fatal for an SME.
              Investors, banks, and suppliers may refuse to do business with the SME because of the high risk of
              failure.
              Recruiting talent becomes much harder, and key employees—especially those in technical or leadership
              roles—might leave for more stable opportunities, further weakening the company’s ability to compete.
              Prospective customers and partners who may view the SME as unreliable or too risky to work with.</p>

              WEALTH.</blockquote>

              <h2>The Subjectivity Poison</h2>
              <div>
                <p>The subjective nature of patent evaluations introduces significant uncertainty into a legal system
                  that
                  strives for objectivity. This uncertainty acts like a poison, spreading into various areas, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Determining the appropriate art unit (department in the Patent Office) for a patent application.
                  </li>
                  <li>Analyzing applications and comparing them to existing inventions.</li>
                  <li>Identifying instances of infringement.</li>
                  <li>Judicial interpretation of patent law.</li>
                  <li>Antitrust and market abuse prosecution.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Furthermore, when large companies use the patent system to drive SMEs out of the market, they acquire
                  an
                  abnormal amount of power over employees, consumers, suppliers, and others. These affected parties
                  often
                  seek
                  relief through legislative action—filing lawsuits or calling for new laws and regulations, such as
                  rules
                  to
                  prevent employee abuse or to require that products are designed to be easy to repair.</p>
                <p>However, this poison of subjectivity has weakened those solutions as well, because any remedy is
                  bound to
                  involve subjective elements. For example, what exactly does "easy to repair" mean? Empowered
                  individuals
                  and
                  companies, which possess significant bargaining power in highly competitive industries, can make such
                  subjective decisions with relative ease. In contrast, asking governments to make these decisions is
                  using
                  the wrong tool for the job.
                </p>

                <blockquote>The patent system moved society from being empowered by individuals with massive bargaining
                  power
                  making distributed decisions—decisions that are resistant to corruption, quick, constantly evolving,
                  inexpensive, and sensitive to local needs—to centralized decisions made by the legal system, which are
                  often
                  slow, expensive, outdated, and easily mistaken or corrupted. We have replaced a flexible system with a
                  rigid
                  one that does not respond well to changes on the ground. Legislative power cannot replace bargaining
                  power
                  due to inherent subjectivity.</blockquote>

          <h1>Patent Problem #2: Ideal Tool for Abuse of Market Power</h1>
          <div>

            <p>Patents are often seen as a way to protect new ideas, but history shows that they can also serve as
              powerful
              tools to acquire and safeguard additional control over entire markets, well beyond technology.</p>

            <p>This raises an interesting question: Could companies amass disproportionate market power without the aid
              of
              patents? Let us analyze some historical examples:</p>

            <p>In the 1950s, Bell System faced a <a
                href="https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/how_antitrust_enforcement.pdf"
                target="_blank">consent
                decree that forced it to freely license thousands of patents</a>, including the transistor, enabling the
              rise of the computer industry in Silicon Valley. Despite retaining control of its telecommunications
              patents,
              Bell lost its grip on many other fields, proving that its monopoly had relied on that broader portfolio of
              technology patents. </p>
            <p>A similar <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1805563" target="_blank">antitrust action struck Xerox in
                the
                1970s</a>, compelling the company to grant licenses for its office copier patents. Although Xerox had
              improved its copiers over time, genuine innovation in the copier market soared only after other firms
              gained
              access to those key patents.</p>

            <p>Aircraft manufacturing in the United States suffered from the Wright brothers’ aggressive patent
              lawsuits,
              which delayed the growth of aviation in the early twentieth century. The threat of legal action and high
              licensing fees forced many potential airplane producers to withdraw from the market. Only when the
              government
              set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturers_Aircraft_Association"
                target="_blank">compulsory
                patent pool in 1917</a>, allowing all manufacturers to use the patents for a small fee, did American
              aviation catch up.</p>
            <p>Later, during World War II, <a
                href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1942/09/we-must-reform-the-patent-law/657291/"
                target="_blank">Thurman Wesley Arnold at the Department of Justice led investigations</a> into various
              industries where patent abuse crippled development, including tungsten carbide tools, fuel additives,
              synthetic rubber, metals, and glass production. There is even a possibility that foreign
              companies—including
              those associated with the Nazi government—exploited American patent laws to undermine competition in the
              United States, while ignoring patents in their own countries to accelerate industrial progress. The reader
              is strongly encouraged to study Thurman Arnold's analysis of patent abuse, as many of these same practices
              are still used today and help explain why the Great Depression was so severe.</p>




            <p>The problem persists in modern times. Firms acquire patents for new drugs and technologies, then charge
              much
              higher prices than foreign or generic alternatives. Powerful companies also threaten smaller rivals with
              expensive lawsuits, forcing them to license weak or questionable patents rather than challenge them in
              court.
              Critics have pointed out that some companies appear to patent innovations specifically to shelve them,
              blocking others from developing or selling competing products.</p>
            <p>Policymakers often struggle to address these abuses because the patent system, by design, introduces
              subjective judgments about what is truly new or non-obvious. This subjectivity opens the door to endless
              legal
              arguments and lobbying that can mask the deeper issue: once a company secures a patent, it can wield that
              privilege to control a market and limit everyone else’s freedom to innovate or compete.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-2">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Patents are intended to grant short-term monopolies over inventions, but they have instead become the
              foundation for permanent control across entire industries, well beyond technology. The legal system
              struggles
              to address these patent and market abuses, due to the subjectivity involved.</p>

          <h1>Patent Problem #3: MAD Oligopolies</h1>
          <div>

            <p>Readers may wonder how companies manage patents and why most markets are not dominated by a single
              monopoly.
            </p>
            <p>The answer lies in a patent strategy known as “Mutually Assured Destruction” (MAD), a concept used in the
              Cold War. In this context, MAD involves companies building large patent portfolios and threatening legal
              action against competitors for patent infringements. This strategy aims to deter rivals from challenging
              their
              patents or to force them into cross-licensing agreements.</p>

            <p>Similar to how MAD kept the United States and the Soviet Union from engaging in full-scale nuclear war,
              large
              corporations use their extensive patent holdings to prevent attacks from competitors. The high costs
              associated with obtaining and defending patents play a significant role in this strategy. For example,
              securing a utility patent in the United States can cost between $5,000 and $7,000 for simple inventions,
              with
              additional fees for patent searches. More complex inventions, such as those in software or satellite
              technology, can cost $15,000 or more, plus higher fees for searches. Defending a patent in court is even
              more
              expensive, ranging from $2 million to $4 million and often taking several years.</p>

            <p>These substantial financial burdens mean that smaller companies cannot afford to build large patent
              portfolios or engage in lengthy legal battles. Only large corporations can use the MAD strategy.</p>
            <p>These corporations avoid outright legal wars but engage in occasional lawsuits (skirmishes) over some
              patent
              infringements, leading to countersuits and private negotiations that establish a new balance of power.
              Once
              a
              patent dispute is resolved, both companies typically continue using the technologies without fear of
              further
              conflicts.</p>

            <p>Over time, this dynamic leads to the formation of oligopolies, where a few dominant companies control the
              majority of a market or industry. In such markets, large competitors continuously infringe on each other’s
              patents but maintain legal peace by using their patent portfolios as deterrents. This creates a
              <b>patent-free
                bubble</b> where these oligopolies can freely use any technology without worrying about infringement
              suits,
              knowing that any legal challenge would result in a costly countersuit.

              <h2>Key Concept: Oligopoly</h2>
              <div>
                <p>For the purposes of this book, we will adopt the UK definition of an oligopoly: a market in which
                  five
                  or
                  fewer companies collectively hold 50% or more of the total market share.</p>
                <p>While duopolies and monopolies do still exist, they are rare. For simplicity, we will refer to all

              <h2>Herd thinking</h2>
              <div>

                <p>Oligopolies often display herd thinking for several reasons. Workers typically remain within the same
                  oligopoly due to industry lock-in, and companies don't have the stick of new competition to force them
                  to
                  adopt new ideas. This
                  results in a shared mindset among the dominant companies. Such uniform thinking increases the
                  likelihood
                  of
                  widespread mistakes and flawed assumptions within the industry, leading to severe consequences such as
                  reduced
                  innovation and increased economic instability.</p>
                <p>A notable example is the oligopoly of rating agencies—Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch
                  Ratings—which
                  controlled approximately 95% of credit ratings in financial markets. Their collective decision to
                  grant
                  AAA
                  ratings to mortgage-backed securities they did not fully understand significantly contributed to the
                  2008
                  financial crisis.</p>
                <p>Another instance of unwise herd thinking is the widespread adoption of just-in-time (JIT) inventory
                  management across various industries. While JIT maximizes profits by keeping stock levels to a
                  minimum, it
                  left many countries vulnerable to supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to
                  shortages
                  of essential items.</p>

              <h2>Decisions by committee</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Decision-making in oligopolies is diluted by committees filled with numerous unaccountable members,
                  instead
                  of decisions by few accountable leaders with skin in the game.</p>
                <p>This approach is driven by the oliopolies unique sitation, where they have little to gain, and a lot
                  to
                  lose:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Their future growth is constrained not because growth is impossible, but because their outdated
                    practices
                    and technologies hinder innovation.</li>
                  <li>As industry leaders, they have much to lose, including market share, reputation with customers,
                    media
                    perception, standing in the financial market, and relationships with government.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Committees are created to mitigate risks by involving multiple stakeholders, helping to identify
                  problems
                  before making major decisions. However, this practice also introduces additional risks—often
                  unacknowledged—such as delays, conservatism, increased complexity, and misaligned incentives among
                  team
                  members and between the committee and the organization.</p>

                <p>Over time, a committee’s focus shifts from effective decision-making to preserving internal harmony.
                  Negotiations become prolonged, and decisions often result in compromises that do not effectively
                  address
                  real
                  problems but instead serve to maintain relationships among committee members.</p>

                <p>Committees also tend to become breeding grounds for political maneuvering, where individuals with
                  personal
                  ambitions manipulate group dynamics for their benefit. Genuine knowledge and skills that could inform
                  better
                  decisions frequently get lost, causing committees to exist primarily to sustain themselves rather than
                  to
                  fulfill their original purpose.</p>

                <blockquote>DECISIONS BY COMMITTEE RESULT IN MISALIGNED INCENTIVES, DELAYS, BUREAUCRACY, COMPLEXITY,

                  DISCONNECTED FROM REALITY, LACK OF INNOVATION, AND EVEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR CORRUPTION.</blockquote>
                <p>At a broader societal level, the rise of oligopolies dominated by sprawling committees represent a

                <p>Historically, humanity has recognized the flaws of central planning, as seen in the Soviet Union
                  and similar experiments. However, we are reverting to centralized decision-making
                  within large corporations, leading to outcomes comparable to those of past centralized systems but on
                  a
                  much
                  larger, global scale, due to the global reach of these corporations, making their

            <div>
              <p>Large companies have the unique advantage of bypassing the patent system by building extensive patent
                portfolios and counter-suing anyone who sues them for infringement. This strategy, known as Mutually
                Assured
                Destruction (MAD), ultimately leads to the formation of oligopolies composed of the companies that
                survive
                this aggressive approach.</p>
              <p>These oligopolies leverage their patent portfolios to harass SMEs, ensuring they maintain dominant
                market
                positions, but this strategy stifles innovation, disrupts supply and demand, and reduces job
                opportunities.
              </p>
              <p>The MAD oligopoly results in entire industries being dominated by herd thinking and decision-making by
                committees.</p>

          <h1>Patent Problem #4: Cascading Oligopolies</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Patents influence not only technology-driven industries but also a wide range of other sectors where
              technology is essential, such as production machinery and management software. Tech based MAD oligopolies
              allow these large companies to favour large partners to achieve economies of scale and other benefits. For
              instance, Foxconn manages most of Apple's manufacturing processes.</p>
            <p>This spread the influence of the original oligopolies into adjacent industries, including those that are
              not
              stereotypically technology-focused, creating similar oligopolies there. This process continues, with each
              new
              oligopoly cascading into further adjacent industries, creating a domino effect.</p>

            <blockquote>THE PROBLEMS IN THE PATENT SYSTEM GENERATE OLIGOPOLIES THAT CASCADE, CREATING OLIGOPOLIES IN
              “PARTNERS” INDUSTRIES: CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, CONSULTANTS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, LOGISTICS
              AND
              TRANSPORTATION OUTFITS, MARKETING AND ADVERTISING AGENCIES, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, INVESTORS,
              LAW/ACCOUNTING/COMPLIANCE PARTNERS, TRADE ASSOCIATIONS, INSURANCE PROVIDERS, SECURITY SERVICES, TECHNOLOGY
              PROVIDERS AND MANY OTHERS.</blockquote>

            <p>A great example of cascading oligopolies into non-technological industries is seen in supermarkets.
              Tech-based oligopolies in suppliers like card systems (point of sale systems) and enterprise resource
              planning
              (ERP) software give large supermarket chains an advantage over smaller competitors. This leads to industry
              consolidation and the formation of supermarket oligopolies. These supermarket oligopolies then pressure
              their
              own partners, such as vegetable farmers and milk producers, who are already under pressure from their own
              tech
              oligopoly suppliers in farming equipment. As a result, these partners must also consolidate into their own
              oligopolies to survive.</p>

            <p>In a free market (without patents), companies would need to work with numerous small enterprises, for the
              sake of innovation, revenue, speed, etc. However, within oligopolies, large firms prioritize policies that
              benefit themselves and their investors, often disadvantaging SMEs:</p>

                    <strong>High Prices that are Disproportionate to Costs:</strong>
                    Inflated prices become a strategy, restricting business access to only the wealthiest companies.
                    This
                    tactic
                    increases profit margins while reducing the overall number of partners, further lowering costs
                    through
                    savings in logistics, paperwork, negotiation, and support time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Discounts and Privileges:</strong>
                    Large partners receive discounts and privileges when they purchase or sell in bulk. These privileges
                    include
                    generous financing options, priority logistics, early access to new products, enhanced services and
                    support,
                    co-marketing and advertisement support, access to data and analytics, customized packaging and
                    branding,
                    regulatory and compliance assistance, exclusive access to innovation labs, and supply chain
                    integration.
                    In
                    contrast, SMEs must pay higher prices and operate under more stringent conditions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Bundles:</strong>
                    Big companies often bundle products and services into large packages. For example, they might sell a
                    range
                    of products when only a few are needed or require partners to purchase a full year's subscription
                    for
                    short-term use. This forces SMEs to pay for unnecessary components, increasing their costs and
                    reducing
                    flexibility.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Preference for Shared Culture:</strong>
                    Large companies prefer to collaborate with partners that share similar cultures and values,
                    including
                    standards for professionalism, communication, and processes. While this reduces risks and
                    miscommunication,
                    it makes it difficult for SMEs to participate in the market.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Vertical Integration:</strong>
                    Big companies control suppliers and distributors through acquisitions, securing direct access to raw
                    materials and components. This reduces dependency on third parties and gives them greater influence
                    over
                    market access and customer relationships.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Channel Squeeze:</strong>
                    Dominant firms pressure suppliers by demanding lower prices or larger discounts, squeezing their
                    profit
                    margins and making it difficult for SMEs to compete.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Exclusive Arrangements:</strong>
                    Companies lock partners into exclusive relationships, preventing them from dealing with competitors
                    and
                    making them dependent on the dominant firm’s preferences.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Regulatory Arbitrage:</strong>
                    Large companies strategically position parts of their production in locations with favorable
                    regulations
                    and
                    exploit loopholes, a strategy that SMEs cannot afford to implement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Lock-ins:</strong>
                    Companies make partners reliant on their products or services, making it difficult for them to
                    switch to
                    alternatives without incurring high costs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Lobbying:</strong>
                    Large firms use their influence to shape government policies and regulations in ways that favor
                    established
                    companies over new entrants, often raising barriers for SMEs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Anti-competitive and illegal behaviors:</strong>
                    such as collusion, price fixing, standardization of contracts and terms, bribing officials (either
                    blatantly or through revolving doors), market allocation (dividing territories or customers among
                    competitors), bid rigging, hiding pollution, fraudulent reporting to shareholders or regulators,
                    manipulating financial markets (spoofing, pump and dump), tax evasion, obstructing investigations by
                    regulators or law enforcement, cybercrimes (such as hacking competitors or sabotaging their
                    systems),
                    and
                    strategic shelving of inventions. These behaviors are much easier to achieve secretly when only a
                    few
                    wealthy players dominate the market.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Hidden Costs:</strong>
                    Oligopolies misrepresent the likelihood of certain events, leading SMEs to incur higher costs than
                    initially
                    anticipated, such as unexpected expenses in implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Automation:</strong>
                    Large companies can afford to automate more, even in the face of worsening services and products for
                    their
                    partners—such as customers, employees, and suppliers—because these partners often have no
                    alternatives
                    or
                    negotiation power. This increased automation leads to greater efficiency, which these companies then
                    leverage to further consolidate their market power.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Payment Difficulties:</strong>
                    Complex and inflexible payment processes can cripple SMEs, which lack the resources to manage delays
                    or
                    negotiate terms effectively.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Changing Requirements:</strong>
                    Large firms frequently alter project requirements, making it difficult for SMEs to meet expectations
                    and
                    maintain stable operations.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Lawfare:</strong>
                    Dominant companies use legal systems to harm competitors through complex contracts, one-sided
                    agreements,
                    and strategic lawsuits, which SMEs cannot afford to defend against.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Unrealistic Demands:</strong>
                    Big firms impose excessive requirements on partners, such as oversized orders and excessive
                    reporting,
                    draining SMEs' resources.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Inflexibility:</strong>
                    Strict processes for payments, contracts, or deliverables make it difficult for SMEs to adapt to
                    large
                    companies' needs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Impatience with Others:</strong>
                    Oligopolistic companies set tight deadlines and show little tolerance for small delays or issues,
                    pressuring
                    SMEs to keep up.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Patience for Oneself:</strong>
                    Ironically, extensive internal delays, bureaucratic processes and mistakes in large companies most
                    be
                    tolerated by SMEs. These problems indirectly hold SMEs hostage, as their resources are tied.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Commoditization of Others:</strong>
                    Dominant firms force partners to offer standardized products or services, making them
                    interchangeable
                    and
                    reducing their profit margins.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>De-commoditization of Oneself:</strong>
                    While commoditizing partners, large companies maintain unique features in their own products to
                    protect
                    profit margins, such as Apple's proprietary "Lightning" chargers and specialized printer ink
                    cartridges.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Denylisting:</strong>
                    Big companies create "no go" lists, excluding dissenting partners from business interactions and
                    sometimes
                    sharing these lists across the industry.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Excessive Bureaucracy:</strong>
                    Lengthy and complex processes, such as vendor onboarding and product inspections, burden SMEs with
                    high
                    costs and delays.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Forced Intermediation:</strong>
                    Large firms impose themselves as mandatory intermediaries in transactions, taking excessive
                    commissions,
                    as
                    seen with app stores charging high fees on in-app purchases.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Intermediary Betrayal of Trust:</strong>
                    Dominant companies use their intermediary roles to later betray partners by launching competing
                    products
                    or
                    exploiting collected data, undermining trust and competition.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Customer abuse:</strong>
                    Price gouging, hidden fees, misleading advertising, planned obsolescence, planned incrementalism,
                    predatory lending, loyalty tax, bait-and-switch tactics, data exploitation, unnecessary upselling,
                    non-transparent

                    false
                    scarcity tactics, discriminatory pricing, inadequate product labeling, selling defective products,
                    poor
                    customer service policies, excessive restocking fees, denial of refunds for valid complaints.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Employee Abuse:</strong>
                    Big firms often exploit employees through practices like wage theft, unpaid overtime, unsafe
                    conditions,
                    restrictive non-compete clauses, and unfair treatment. SMEs rarely can get away with similar
                    practices.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>SMEs are often at the receiving end of many of these tactics, making it difficult for them to

                  alone thrive, as large companies effectively set the rules of their relationships.</p>
                <p>Even if an SME escapes such mistreatment by not being directly involved with an oligopolistic
                  company,
                  they
                  still frequently must compete with these dominant firms. Large companies can (literally and
                  figuratively)
                  afford to engage in many unethical and sometimes illegal behaviors, hide their tracks, and hire
                  massive
                  teams of lawyers to defend themselves if they are ever prosecuted. This allows oligopolistic companies
                  to
                  obtain unfair advantages in the job market, enabling them to out-recruit, out-advertise, out-invest,
                  and
                  excel in many essential areas compared to competing SMEs.</p>

                <p>The result is consolidation of companies in adjacent industries, creating new oligopolies —
                  comprising
                  the
                  few large entities that could survive such abuses and consolidated to have the necessary negotiating
                  power
                  to stand up to the original oligopoly — and thus reinforcing the cycle of consolidation.</p>

                <p>While many of these tactics are used by any large company, they become much more common and impactful
                  within oligopolies. In a free market (without patents), large companies would still exist but would
                  not
                  rely
                  on patents or oligopoly
                  connections to dominate. They would face constant competition, making it risky to mistreat partners or
                  push
                  them toward new competitors.</p>

                      SMEs

                  <h3>Government mismanagement of the economy</h3>

                  <div>
                    <p>Oligopolies reduce job opportunities, innovation, and supply and demadn leading to a weaker

                      market, which is compounded during economic crises or disasters like pandemics. To stimulate
                      economic
                      activity, governments often lower interest rates and print money. However, this additional money
                      typically
                      benefits large companies for several reasons:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Ease of Borrowing:</strong> Big companies, with their strong financial histories and
                        stable
                        market
                        positions, can borrow funds more easily than individuals, new companies, or SMEs.</li>
                      <li><strong>Cantillon Effect:</strong> Extra money enters the economy unevenly, first reaching
                        well-connected
                        firms, often financial institutions, and driving up stock prices of oligopoly companies. New
                        companies
                        and
                        SMEs rarely benefit.</li>
                      <li><strong>Investment in Stock Market:</strong> Low interest rates encourage households to invest
                        in the
                        stock market, which is dominated by oligopolies.</li>
                      <li><strong>Government Purchases:</strong> Governments buy corporate debt to support the market,
                        often
                        targeting large companies.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>With increased money supply, oligopolies use the funds to acquire competitors, merge with other
                      firms,
                      buy
                      back shares, and obtain more patents. These actions strengthen oligopolies, making them less
                      vulnerable to
                      competition and better equipped for costly legal battles.</p>

                    <p>Long periods of low interest rates create market bubbles. When these bubbles burst, governments
                      intervene
                      to
                      support large companies deemed "too big to fail" to prevent economic collapse. They may also prop
                      up
                      "zombie"
                      companies that cannot generate enough profit to cover expenses. This support prevents new
                      companies from
                      emerging and eliminates opportunities for smaller businesses.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, large companies have substantial financial resources, allowing them to borrow more
                      during
                      uncertain times. This advantage enables them to buy or harass struggling SMEs, further
                      consolidating their
                      market dominance and reducing competition.</p>

                    <blockquote>WHEN THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, OLIGOPOLIES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CHEAP MONEY TO GROW MORE AND
                      SWALLOW
                      COMPETITORS; WHEN THE ECONOMY IS STRUGGLING, OLIGOPOLIES RECEIVE EXTRA HELP FROM GOVERNMENTS AND
                      ABSORB
                      STRUGGLING COMPETITORS. HEADS OR TAILS, OLIGOPOLIES WIN.</blockquote>

                    <p>Complex regulations and legislation inadvertently strengthen oligopolies by creating barriers for
                      smaller
                      competitors. In economies dominated by oligopolies, declining tax revenues reduce the government's
                      ability
                      to
                      monitor the private sector effectively. This lack of oversight allows oligopolies to engage in bad
                      practices
                      such as unsafe lending,
                      mistreat employees, and harm the environment without facing consequences. Oligopolies can also
                      manipulate
                      information or bribe government officials to protect their interests.</p>

                    <p>When malpractice is exposed, governments often respond by enacting more complex regulations and
                      reporting
                      requirements instead of enforcing existing rules. These new regulations increase compliance costs,
                      making
                      it
                      difficult for SMEs to compete. Large firms can afford extensive compliance teams, while smaller
                      companies
                      struggle with the expenses, further entrenching oligopolies.</p>

                <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-4">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Patents are often associated with technology, but they also help form oligopolies in various
                  unrelated
                  industries. An initial oligopoly uses different strategies to ensure that large companies dominate
                  related
                  fields, causing a ripple effect that creates more oligopolies, much like an epidemic. However, there
                  is a
                  positive side. Removing patents from an industry once controlled by an oligopoly can introduce
                  competition.
                  This change discourages the formation of oligopolies in related sectors, leading to a positive ripple
                  effect. Increased competition and job creation can revitalize the economy, turning a harmful cycle
                  into a
                  beneficial one.</p>

          <h1>Patent Problem #5: The Global Shadow Patent System</h1>

          <div>
            <p>One argument in defense of the patent system is that countries with few patent applications tend to
              struggle in terms of innovation and economic growth, while countries that receive the most patent
              applications thrive. Does this not indicate that patents help the economy and foster innovation?</p>
            <p>This paradox is explained by the global shadow patent system established through international
              agreements
              like TRIPS, which require countries to prioritize patents filed abroad.</p>

            <p>As a result, even though patents are only valid in the countries where they are granted, once a patent
              is
              granted in a new country, any existing use (very suddenly) becomes illegal, forcing local industries to
              abandon products or negotiate costly licenses. This creates a <b>de facto global patent protection
                system</b>, where patents must be assumed to cover the entire world.</p>

            <blockquote>IN THEORY, THERE IS NO GLOBAL PATENT SYSTEM, AS EACH COUNTRY HAS ITS OWN INDEPENDENT PATENT
              SYSTEM. IN PRACTICE, THERE IS A GLOBAL <u>SHADOW</u> PATENT SYSTEM, WHICH EFFECTIVELY PREVENTS THE USE
              OF
              ANY TECHNOLOGY PATENTED ABROAD.</blockquote>

            <p>Additionally, the patent system hinders Education in poorer countries. Without access to patented
              technologies, these countries cannot train workers to use advanced tools and processes, limiting their
              economic growth. For example, the inability to use tungsten carbide before World War II due to patent
              restrictions slowed American industrial development.</p>

            <p>Most people in these countries are unaware of how patents restrict their economic progress, similar to
              fish
              being unaware of polluted water.</p>

            <p>Patent offices in smaller or less powerful countries struggle to challenge patents from major markets,
              allowing large companies to maintain their dominance and restrict competition globally.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-5">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>In summary, obtaining a patent in one country, especially a developed country, in practice establishes
              that
              patent over the entire planet, discouraging the whole of humanity from using the related technology, and
              indirectly spreading the patent problems we are discussing all over the globe.</p>

          <h1>Intermission</h1>

          <div>

            <p>After examining these initial patent problems, it is an appropriate time to pause and develop a mental
              picture of the situation. An effective way to visualize the patent system is to view it as a dangerous
              virus. For simplicity we can consider it in two stages: increased viral potency and a global epidemic.
            </p>

            <p><b>Increased viral potency</b>, the virus becomes stronger:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Subjectivity:</b> The subjectivity of borders between ideas gives an advantage to large
                corporations,
                which use their size to acquire vast numbers of patents with uncertain scopes, and large legal teams
                to
                defend those patents. These patent portfolios and legal teams are used to bully SMEs that challenge
                their
                market share.</li>
              <li><b>Market abuse:</b> These large corporations then extend their influence over entire markets,
                expanding
                their dominance well beyond technologies.</li>
              <li><b>MAD oligopolies:</b> Oligopolies are formed by the few companies that survive the MAD strategy,
                where
                each large company infringes on the others’ patents but cannot be prosecuted for it.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These problems, together with the next twenty-plus patent problems that will be examined, compound to
              increase the potency of this virus. This heightened potency inflicts greater damage on its host—namely,
              specific industries.</p>

            <p><b>Global epidemic</b>, the virus spreads in two ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Across industries:</b> These tech-based oligopolies then cascade into adjacent markets, even
                those
                that are less stereotypically technological, creating a domino effect.</li>
              <li><b>Across countries:</b> Oligopolies assert their dominance globally by leveraging the global shadow
                patent system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This ultra-potent virus becomes extremely infectious. It spreads uncontrollably through other
              industries,
              countries and the global economy, causing widespread harm. </p>


            <p>The number of examples of these oligopolies is daunting. Consider this just a sample of the most
              well-known
              ones:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Consumer Goods and Retail:</b> Supermarkets and convenience stores, personal care products, soft
                drinks, beer, luxury goods, fast food chains, breakfast cereals, pet food, coffee chains, energy
                drinks,
                tobacco, toy manufacturers, theme parks, athletic footwear, cosmetics, dairy products, furniture
                retailers, home appliances, office supply retailers, movie theatre chains.</li>
              <li><b>Health:</b> Pharmaceuticals manufacturers, pharmaceutical distribution, eyewear, diapers, baby
                formula, insulin, medical device manufacturers, Healthcare IT, diagnostic laboratories, dietary
                supplements, safety equipment, dental products, hospital chains.</li>
              <li><b>Technology and Electronics:</b> Smartphones, semiconductors, video games (consoles and
                platforms),
                consumer electronics, hearing aids, cloud computing, streaming platforms, search engines.</li>
              <li><b>Industrial and Manufacturing:</b> Automobiles, residential and commercial elevators, agriculture
                machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, construction equipment, cement production, chemicals, shipping and
                logistics, industrial gases, steel manufacturing, glass manufacturing.</li>
              <li><b>Services and Professional Industries:</b> Consulting firms, accounting firms, law firms, courier
                and
                delivery services, wireless carriers, internet service providers, payment processors, banking,
                financial
                services, insurance, health insurance, stock exchanges, clearing houses.</li>
              <li><b>Transportation and Travel:</b> Airlines, aircraft manufacturers, automobiles manufacturers, car
                rentals, automotive components and tires, cruise lines, ride-sharing services, railroads, shipping
                container manufacturers, freight companies.</li>
              <li><b>Media and Entertainment:</b> Media conglomerates, music streaming services, video streaming
                platforms, book publishing.</li>
              <li><b>Energy and Natural Resources:</b> Petroleum retail and refining, electric utilities, natural gas
                production, mining and metals.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The patent system is not the only factor contributing to the creation of oligopolies; regulatory
              environments and market dynamics also play significant roles. However, the patent system remains a major
              contributor.</p>

            <p>Even if we generously assume that each oligopoly only has a small negative impact, such as a 1%
              increase
              in
              prices and a 1% decrease in available jobs, the large number of oligopolies compound their effects. This
              results in significant increases in the cost of living and the severely poor job market we see today.
            </p>

            <p>Some argue that oligopolies are natural outcomes of economies of scale, network effects, and modern
              technologies, which tend to concentrate market power in a few players. However, this perspective
              overlooks
              several facts:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Investors should be eager to invest vast amounts of money in new challengers to these oligopolies,
                as
                the returns are very promising.</li>
              <li>Many oligopolies have not seen changes in their membership for many decades.</li>
              <li>Countries known for patent piracy, such as China today, often have thriving competition.</li>
              <li>Chinese brands are frequently the only ones challenging Western oligopolies, unintentionally
                preventing
                a global cost of living crisis by providing affordable goods.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We will explore patent pirates later in this book.</p>

            <p>We could conclude our critique of the patent system at this point, as its foundational principle—that
              ideas
              have non-subjective boundaries—crumbles under even slight scrutiny, delivering a death blow to patents.
              This
              flawed foundation propagates market abuse and the formation of oligopolies across various industries and
              regions.</p>

            <p>However, we will continue to enumerate the many detrimental effects of the patent system, allowing it
              to
              die a thousand cuts if necessary, and in case readers find some problems more serious or pertinent than
              others. Although many of the subsequent issues have roots in subjectivity, the reader is encouraged to
              set
              that aside to maintain the semblance of a solid logical foundation as we analyze further problems.</p>

          <h1>Patent Problem #6: Reliably Detecting Obvious Patents</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Patent examiners must determine if patent application is obvious to an "average skilled worker in the
              industry". Their inability to identify and reject obvious inventions is well knonw.
              The problem is the assumption that every patent examiner has the same mental image of what this "average
              skilled worker" is. Workers have varying levels and types of
              intelligence, experience, training, and access to resources.</p>
            <p>Even if patent offices had unlimited resources, the fundamental problems would persist. Industries are
              becoming increasingly complex, so it's impossible to reliably determine what is common knowledge today
              and
              what is not, and if an invention is genuinely new or obvious.</p>
            <p>Patent offices are attempting to be omniscient; they feign an understanding of all industries
              simultaneously,
              including the current state of technology in every one of them. </p>

              <h2>Prizes</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Some would argue that we should be able to identify obvious ideas to deny them patents, given we have
                  the
                  ability the identify the opposite, very smart ideas via prizes such as Nobel prizes or Oscars.</p>
                <p>However, prizes are drastically different mechanisms, and far superior to patents, due to three main
                  reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Due process:</b> Prizes are only granted after extensive due process such as research and
                    comitee
                    dsicussions, whereas patents in the US for example, are often granted after being reviewed by only 1
                    or
                    2
                    patent examiners, after only an average of 19h of examination.</li>
                  <li><b>Stakes:</b> Prizes have low stakes, mistakes are at most embarassing. Wrongly granting patents
                    can
                    drive companies out of business and stifle innovation in entire industries.</li>
                  <li><b>Timing:</b> Prizes are granted after an idea has proven itself, while patents are granted to
                    the
                    smallest ideas, before they have ever proven to be of value.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Patent offices often grant patents to obvious inventions, giving big companies and advantage, as

                can
                obtain more such patents and use them against SMEs, therefore
                decreasing the number of jobs in the economy.</li>
              <li>Prizes are drastically different mechanism to regognize and incentivize ideas, but far suprior to
                patents,
                because they are only granted after extensive due process, have low stakes to society, and are granted
                after

          <h1>Patent Problem #7: Retaining Talent in the Patent Office</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Patent offices need examiners who are well-versed in the latest technology within their industry
              specialization. However, many industries offer higher pay, better career prospects, less stress, and
              more
              engaging work than a patent office can provide.</p>
            <p>Most examiners at a patent office are inexperienced, which hinders their ability to detect obvious
              inventions, identify relevant prior art, or recognize incomplete disclosures about how an invention
              works.
            </p>
            <p>As a result, despite the existence of a formal patent-examination process, the system often operates
              more
              like a registration system, in that a determined patentee can often secure almost any patent they
              pursue.
              While the claims granted may not be as extensive as initially desired, a patent is likely to be issued
              after
              the revisions.</p>

            <p>Some would argue that any goverment agency that oversees industries face the same problem, like the FDA
              or
              environmenta agencies, but their narrow scope allow their employees to specialize in fewer subjects, and
              they
              can levereage experts to create high level rules and procedures, which can them be applied by a mass of
              less
              experienced workers facing predicatable problems.</p>

            <p>Patent Offices pretend to be omniscient, covering all industries and all existing technologies, and
              every
              patent application is (theoretically) a completely new invention, making it impossible to create high
              levle
              rules and procedures like other goverment agencies.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-7">Conclusion</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Patent offices around the world face an impossible challenge in acquiring and retaining talent,
                given
                their unrealistic ambition of overseeing every industry. This results in more invalid patents being
                granted,
                again benefiting large companies, which can accumulate more of these invalid patents and use them
                against
                SMEs, reducing jobs, competition, and innovation.</li>

          <h1>Patent Problem #8: Fake Inventions</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Another unacknowledged fundamental assumption of the patent system is the common-sense expectation that
              the
              patented invention should work, meaning that it should perform the functions described. Surprisingly and
              disturbingly, a patent office typically does not know if an invention works or is a fake.</p>
            <p>The case of Theranos, a company that received hundreds of patents for questionable technologies,
              illustrates
              this problem. The company used its patent portfolio to gain credibility and attract employees,
              investments
              and
              media attention.</p>

            <p>Checking if an invention really works as claimed is difficult because:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Logistical constraints:</b> Inventions often involve large-scale machinery, hazardous materials,
                perishable components, present considerable difficulties in transportation, testing, and storage.
                That’s
                why
                inventors cannot bring a physical version of the invention to the patent office.</li>
              <li><b>Resource limitations:</b> Even if functional models were readily available, objectively
                evaluating
                their performance would be hampered by tight timelines and resource constraints. </li>
              <li><b>Information asymmetry:</b> The assessment often relies heavily on the information provided in the
                application itself, only words and diagrams on paper, alongside the examiner's existing knowledge.
                This
                creates a disparity in available resources, disadvantaging the examiner compared with the inventor,
                who
                usually has an extensive research team and a development background.</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>PATENT EXAMINERS ARE FORCED TO LITERALLY GUESS IF AN INVENTION COULD CREDIBLY WORK.
            </blockquote>

            <p>This is one of the many reasons why measuring innovation by the number of patents issued to a company
              or
              country is a deeply flawed measurement. </p>

            <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-8">Conclusion</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>It's impossible to check if an invention works without spending vast amounts of resources, which
                patent
                offices would never be able to do. </li>
              <li>This is not merely a problem of useless patents being granted. These fake inventions discourage real
                innovators, as they could face legal troubles if they create a technology that a bogus patent claimed,
                but
                never delivered. Illegitimate patents create a legal minefield for real inventors, decreasing
                innovation
                and
                job creation.</li>

          <h1>Patent Problem #9: Gridlocks Due to Overlapping Property Rights</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Patents do not grant any new rights to inventors. Inventors already had the right to use, make, or sell
              their
              inventions before they received their patents.</p>
            <p>Most economists think of patents as “negative rights,” i.e., the power to stop others from doing things
              with
              their property, In that sense, patents are more like censorship than property, as patent holders can
              censor
              how others use their own property.</p>
            <blockquote>PATENTS ARE NOT ABOUT GIVING RIGHTS TO INVENTORS. THEY ARE ABOUT TAKING AWAY RIGHTS FROM
              OTHERS
            </blockquote>

            <p>Companies struggle to determine how many patent holders have a saying on the use of their own property,
              let
              alone negotiate licenses with all of them. This leads to a gridlock, or what economists call the
              “tragedy
              of
              the anticommons”.</p>

            <blockquote>THIS IS MORE THAN A THEORETICAL DISCUSSION: IT MATTERS BECAUSE PATENTS CREATE OVERLAPPING
              RIGHTS
              TO
              THE SAME PROPERTY — THE RIGHTS OF THE REAL OWNER AND THE UNCLEAR RIGHTS OF UNTOLD NUMBERS OF PATENT
              HOLDERS

                they

          <h1>Patent Problem #10: Non-Practicing Entities and Patent Trolls</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Non-Practicing Entities (NPEs) acquire patents without the intention of developing or using the
              patented
              inventions. They cannot be counter-sued for patent infringement, because they don't produce anything
              themselves. These entities, sometimes called “patent trolls,” exploit the complexities and
              subjectivities
              of
              the patent
              system to extract licensing fees or litigation settlements from companies that are actually producing
              and
              using the technologies.</p>

            <p>But contrary to popular opinion, these pratices have existed for a long time, and such entities cannot
              be
              easily identified to curb their practices. A study found that stereotypical characteristics such as
              source
              of
              patents, patent quality, rate of which their patents are invalidated, and litigation patterns, are all
              similar
              to normal companies. </p>
            <p>The study concludes that the classification of an NPE as a "troll" often depends on <b>subjective</b>
              perspectives, and the term is used to denigrate opponents in situations where fairness is contested.</p>

            <article>
              <h2>A blessing in disguise</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Many people in industry think that NPEs and patent trolls exploit those who do honest work, that they
                  are
                  despicable economic parasites. But NPEs and patent trolls offer a hidden benefit in the long run: They
                  are
                  helping to speed up the end of the patent system. </p>

                <p>NPEs and patent trolls are real-life embodiments of “reductio ad absurdum,” a strategy of disproving
                  an
                  argument by showing how absurd it is when taken to its logical conclusion. These entities are exposing
                  the
                  absurdity of the patent system by taking it to the extreme; they make the insanity obvious to anyone
                  paying
                  attention. In truth, all patent infringement cases are baseless because the very idea of having a
                  monopoly
                  on
                  an idea (the invention) is absurd, generating court cases that are absurd.</p>

                <p>Some have proposed ways to curb such behaviors, requiring companies to use the patent themselves. But
                  this
                  runs into more subjectivity: What counts as “using” a patent exacxtly ? It’s the subjectivity poison
                  showing
                  up again.</p>

                <p>The more we think about NPEs and patent trolls and how to stop them, the more we realize that there
                  is
                  no
                  clear line between using the patent system honorably and dishonestly.</p>

                likely continue. The issue isn't the entities doing this: they are just using the patent system as it

          <h1>Patent Problem #11: Patents Lasting Longer Than Inventions</h1>
          <div>
            <p>While inventions can theoretically last forever, their practical lifespan in the market is limited by
              factors
              like technological advancements and changing consumer preferences. As technology
              advances rapidly, inventions become obsolete more quickly, making the 20-year patent term from the
              filing
              date
              increasingly problematic, as more and more market useful inventions are trapped under active patentes.
            </p>

            <p>The fundamental purpose of the patent system is to incentivize innovation by providing a
              <b>short-term</b>
              incentive to inventors in the form of a <b>temporary</b> monopoly that would quickly expire, enabling
              the
              general population to freely benefit from the invention.
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore essential that the monopoly period granted by patents be shorter than the average
              lifespan
              of
              an invention. If an invention is obsolete by the time the patent expires, the fundamental mechanism of
              the
              patent system breaks down. </p>
            <p>However, the situation we have now is that the The original patent holder, benefiting from the
              invention-related income, customer feedback, and production experience, can secure de facto <b>forever
                patents</b> by remaining in a unique and exclusive position to develop newer versions of the
              technology
              and
              patenting them, thus ensuring that they maintain their monopoly forever, and that competitors never have
              a
              chance to catch up.</p>

            <p>Forever patents are one of several patent problems that allow companies to abuse customers in various
              ways,
              such as practicing planned obsolescence, shelving useful inventions, or making their products impossible
              to
              repair. When a company does not have to fear any competition, it can engage in profitable but unethical
              behavior that runs counter to its customers’ preferences. If the company faced real competition, such
              conduct
              would be unwise, because it would give challengers an advantage.</p>

            <p>That’s why this book is subtitled “How the Patent System <b>Strangled</b> Innovation, Job Creation and
              the
              Economy.” Patents act like a noose around society's neck: As time passes, even if patent laws remain
              unchanged, the noose tightens; more and more valuable inventions become trapped by patents, resulting in
              the
              strangling of innovation, job creation, and the economy.</p>

            <p>This phenomena also helps explain teh productivity paradox, around the 1970s, something "broke" in the
              global
              economy: where significant investments in technology and innovations have not led to the expected gains
              in
              productivity.</p>
            <p>We posit the main reason for this was that the average lifespan of an invention dipped bellow the
              duration
              of
              patents (20y) around that time, allowing big companies to obtain a forever patent potfolio, therefore
              newer
              technologies that could be more productive were never allowed to diffuse through society, preventing
              companies
              (especially SMEs) from becoming more productive.</p>

            <p>The knee-jerk suggestion often heard is to shorten the duration of patents in industries where
              innovation
              moves faster. However, this would allow patent applications to be reworded so they fit under an art unit
              with
              a longer term, and it would trigger intense lobbying, with every industry trying to secure a longer
              patent
              term than others. Some propose reducing the duration of all patents, regardless of the field, but, just
              like
              the first idea, deciding on a new term length is highly subjective. Who can determine the “correct”
              number
              of
              years? Even if we found that magical figure and it worked for now, the problem of patents outlasting
              inventions would eventually return as the pace of innovation catches up. It would also fail to fix many
              of
              the
              other patent issues we are debating.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Abolishing the patent system promises to address the productivity paradox and corporate abuses such
                as
                planned obsolescence, shelving useful inventions, or making products impossible to repair. Doing so
                would
                also free numerous SMEs to innovate, bringing more competition and, most importantly, creating greater

            <p>The problem is that with the more dependencies an invention has, the more difficult it is to find all
              the
              releveant patent holders, let aloen try to negative licenses with each of them. The result is a bias
              towards
              low level inventions that have very few dependencies.</p>
            <blockquote>THE BIAS FAVORING LOW-LEVEL INVENTIONS HAS PERSISTED SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PATENT SYSTEM,
              POTENTIALLY CAUSING HUMANITY TO MISS ENTIRE REALMS OF INVENTIONS.</blockquote>
            <p>For example, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1509432/000119312511240287/ds1.htm"
                target="_blank">the patent aggregator RPX stated in 2011</a> that there are more than 250,000 active
              patents
              relevant to today’s smartphones. If a new company (an SME) tried negotiate with even 1% of these patents
              licenses, it would be a massive consumption of time alone, imagine the cost in licensing fees.</p>
            <p>By prioritizing low-level inventions, we are diverting investment away from higher-level inventions,
              without
              any analytical or scientific reasons to do so. </p>

            <p>This patent problem enables tactics similar to those used by organized crime, such as those employed by
              the
              Mafia. After a business has invested substantial effort and resources to grow, it is confronted by an
              entity
              demanding payment for the use of lower level inventions. This demand, which is like threatening to break
              the
              company's metaphorical kneecaps, brings a coercive element that can disrupt and harm the business's
              stability
              and growth prospects, especially SMEs.</p>

            <p>The higher the invention level, the worse the problem gets, as higher-level inventions depend on many
              lower-level inventions. In one distressing example, in <a
                href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/08/business/bristol-myers-and-athersys-make-deal-on-gene-patents.html"
                target="_blank">2001 biopharmaceutical company Bristol Myers Squibb announced</a> that it would not
              investigate "more than 50 proteins possibly involved in cancer” because patent holders "either would not
              allow
              it or were demanding unreasonable royalties.” Patent discussions are not just about innovation and
              economics,
              human lives are at risk.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Patents create an unintentional bias towards low level inventions to avoid licences and problems of

          <h1>Patent Problem #13: Bias Towards Existing Technology Stacks</h1>
          <div>
            <p>This is another unintentional buys in teh patent system, encouraging market players to focus heavily on
              improving existing technologies with expired patents, or building on top of them.</p>
            <p>They do not risk launching new and revolutionary technologies, as these would be dependent on many
              lower-level inventions under active patents, resulting in the high costs associated with patent
              licensing
              and
              a massive risk of patent litigation.</p>
            <p>That's why innovation nowadays is evolutionary, instead of revolutionary. </p>
            <p>The reader is encouraged to look at photos and videos from decades past, and notice how little the
              world
              and
              the average household has changed.</p>
            <p>The only exception is the computer/software/internet revolution, technologies that were created by
              ignoring
              the patent system, as we can learn in "The Past" section of the book.</p>

            <p>A crucial point is that existing technologies have been used for such a long time that they have become
              heavily automated and require very few workers. By contrast, new technologies are more difficult to
              automate
              and generate jobs by compelling companies to adopt fresh systems, replace outdated ones, follow trends,
              or
              handle the complexity of multiple technologies (Breakthroughs, Obsolescence, Trends, and Complexity). As
              older
              technologies dominate, automation exceeds what would normally appear in a free market, creating a
              substantial
              imbalance in which job losses due to automation outpace job gains from innovation. The slow pace of
              evolutionary change exacerbates the situation, since companies can take their time adapting automation
              to
              each
              new version of technology, or only release updated products after thoroughly automating them, which
              further
              reduces employment.

            <p>This systemic bias toward established technologies divides industries into two markets:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Undifferentiated masses:</b> Most firms (comprised of mostly SMEs) are unable to pursue genuine
                innovation and are forced to compete on undifferentiated products and services. This results in low
                profit
                margins, poor employee wages, and limited growth potential.</li>
              <li><b>Large Corporations:</b> Few companies leverage extensive patent portfolios and periodically
                release
                marginally updated technologies. This allows them to differentiate themselves, minimize risk, and
                capture
                the majority of the market share. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-13">Conclusion</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Without patents, companies of any size would be able to produce completely new and original
                products,
                and
                that is what humankind desperately needs, not only for job generation and innovation, but also for the
                environment and our health, as the new technologies would likely be a better fit for our needs.</li>

          <div>
            <p>The patent system unintentionally encourages more automation than a patent-free market would normally
              allow, in five distinct ways:</p>


            <article>
              <h2>Preventing Diffusion</h2>
              <div>
                <p>
                  Let us review the innovation cycle:</p>
                <img src="images/innovation_cycle.png" />
                <p>The implementation of an invention occurs in two phases, each affecting jobs differently, regardless
                  of
                  the
                  patent system:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><b>Introduction:</b> Market players will naturally lean towards finding low-risk, high-reward and
                    predictable opportunities that require minimal investment (the low hanging fruits). The best
                    candidate
                    that
                    fits the bill is often automation of current processes, which are obviously job destroying.</li>
                  <li><b>Diffusion: </b> Once the low hanging fruits are exausted, tmarket players are forced into
                    riskier
                    and
                    more complex ventures, requiring market fit, investments, training, support, etc. These tend to be
                    new
                    products, businesses, and projects, which are obviously job creating.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The patent system disrupts this natural balance by intentionally obstructing the Diffusion phase to
                  protect
                  the exclusivity of inventions. This suppression of innovation dampens job creation while allowing the
                  job-destroying forces of automation in the Introduction phase to proceed unchecked, leading to a
                  significant
                  imbalance in the labor market.</p>

              <h2>Shelving inventions</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Patent owners, often benefiting from an already profitable business model, may view new
                  technologies—particularly those unsuited for automation—as a threat to their existing investments or
                  profitability. To protect their interests, these companies have an incentive to secure patents, not to
                  use
                  the
                  inventions, but to block competitors from utilizing them. This practice, known as shelving patents,
                  stifles
                  innovation by preventing potentially valuable technologies from being developed or implemented.</p>

                <p>A great example of is how <a

                    but
                    not implementing them</a>. Nader summarized it well in <a

                    is what competition is all about. But it also wrecks evenings and weekends for auto company brass,

              <h2>Patent piracy in automation is undetectable</h2>

              <div>
                <p>Inventions can be categorized based on their implementation location:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><b>Producer side: </b> exclusively within companies for operations, manufacturing, or
                    infrastructure
                    (e.g., production machinery, AI-driven systems). These technologies are inaccessible to the public
                    and
                    therefore difficult to reverse engineer, making them an ideal space for using patent-infringing
                    innovations
                    safely and discreetly.</li>
                  <li><b>Consumer side: </b> Inventions directly accessible to consumers, either as general-use products
                    or
                    initially limited to specialists (e.g., smartphones, cars, tools). These technologies are easily
                    accessible
                    to the public and therefore very easy to reverse engineer and detect patent infringments, therefore
                    carrying
                    high risk. making them an ideal space for using patent-infringing innovations safely and discreetly.
                    However
                    these are the technologies that can drive innovation, fostering job creation through Breakthroughs,
                    Trends,
                    Obsolescence and Complexity.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Since consumer-side innovation invites scrutiny and potential patent disputes, companies often opt
                  for
                  producer-side inventions, specially because they don't need to respect the patent system there. The
                  result
                  is that primarily automation is advanced, limiting the broader job-creating potential of innovations.
                </p>

                <p>Patent piracy in automation gives large companies a distinct advantage over SMEs. Big companies can
                  invest in in-house engineering teams focused solely on automation, often ignoring patent concerns
                  because
                  any infringement remains confined to internal processes. They also acquire firms specializing in
                  automated
                  manufacturing, quickly gaining skilled personnel and valuable technologies while blocking competitors.
                </p>

                <p>In contrast, SMEs lack the funds and expertise to develop their own automation. They are forced to
                  purchase off-the-shelf and publicly available technologies that avoid patented technologies. This
                  results in less efficient and more
                  expensive automation solutions for SMEs, further worsening their competitive disadvantage.</p>

              <h2>Slowing Introduction to match automation</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Companies with patent monopolies face limited competition, allowing them to proceed slowly and focus
                  on
                  optimizing automation for labor-intensive processes. They often introduce new products and services
                  incrementally, delaying the use of their latest inventions to continue benefiting from existing
                  automation
                  technologies. This gradual approach reduces the need for human workers.</p>

                <p>In contrast, a patent-free environment would create competitive pressure, forcing companies to
                  implement
                  inventions quickly to stay ahead. This urgency would limit the time available to prioritize automation
                  before
                  releasing new products, potentially preserving and creating jobs.</p>

              <h2>Appeasing investors to the detriment of everyone else</h2>
              <div>
                <p>In a free market, companies compete for partners — whether individuals or other companies — who
                  belong
                  to
                  one
                  of four groups: <b>employees</b>, <b>suppliers</b>, <b>customers</b>, and <b>investors</b>. However,
                  one
                  of
                  these groups stands out from the others.</p>

                <p>Most employees, suppliers, and customers are industry-locked, meaning that they cannot easily switch
                  industries if they feel undercompensated or unfairly treated.</p>
                <p>The only group not tightly industry-locked is investors. For them, investments in one company or
                  industry
                  can
                  be withdrawn and reinvested in a completely different industry.</p>
                <p>Since employees are often the biggest expense for most companies, the optimal solution for pleasing
                  investors
                  is automation, even if the reduction in staff will make things worse for customers, suppliers, or for
                  the
                  remaining employees</p>

                <blockquote>OLIGOPOLISTS DO NOT NEED TO WORRY MUCH ABOUT COMPETITION FOR EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, OR
                  CUSTOMERS,
                  AS
                  THESE GROUPS HAVE FEW ALTERNATIVES. INSTEAD, THEY PRIMARILY COMPETE FOR INVESTORS, WHO HAVE MANY
                  OPTIONS
                  AND
                  THEREFORE MUST BE PLEASED AND APPEASED. ONE OF THE BEST SOLUTIONS FOR ATTRACTING AND RETAINING
                  INVESTORS
                  IS
                  AUTOMATION.</blockquote>

                <p>The focus on pleasing investors, often at the expense of other groups, contributes to the broader
                  problem
                  of
                  the financialization of the economy, in which the needs and preferences of the financial market are
                  predominant.</p>

                <p>In a true free market (without patents), oligopolies would be rare, and companies would have
                  to also compete heavily for customers, employees and suppliers. This competition would prevent them
                  from
                  lowering their product and service standards and force them to constantly innovate, which would
                  require
                  more
                  workers.</p>

                <p>The focus on pleasing investors, often at the expense of customers, suppliers, and employees,
                  contributes
                  to
                  the broader problem of financialization, where the needs of the financial market take priority.
                  Investors
                  also
                  have undue power over companies, pushing them to improve their bottom line, even via unethical
                  practices
                  directed at employees, suppliers, and customers. Exploitation of employees is well documented in the
                  media,
                  and exploitation of suppliers will be addressed in the section on “Cascading Oligopolies.” Here, we
                  will
                  focus
                  on the exploitation of customers.</p>

                <p>Shelving inventions, planned obsolescence, or making products difficult to repair are only the tip of
                  the
                  iceberg. Other forms of disrespect for customers include:
                  deceptive practices (misleading advertising, hidden fees), data exploitation (unethical data
                  collection,
                  selling customer data), manipulative pricing strategies (dynamic pricing, bait-and-switch),
                  undermining
                  consumer rights (forced arbitration clauses, non-refundable rules), psychological manipulation
                  (addictive
                  design, false urgency) and exploiting customer loyalty (loyalty program abuse, excessive price
                  increases)

                  investments
                  (like automation) rather than riskier job-creating ventures (e.g., new product lines or factories).
                  Competitors who might have pursued those ventures are legally blocked.</li>
                <li>Market leaders often patent potentially disruptive technologies and then keep them off the market
                  (“shelve” them), preventing competitors from using them. However, any invention that improves
                  automation
                  or
                  profitability is not shelved.</li>
                <li>Patent infringement is difficult to detect in private settings like factories, so automation-related
                  innovations—often used internally—are relatively free from scrutiny.</li>
                <li>Large companies have dedicated teams of engineers who focus on automating their internal processes
                  while largely bypassing patent concerns. In contrast, SMEs must buy off-the-shelf automation from the
                  public market, where any patent infringements are quickly noticed. As a result, large companies enjoy
                  the best available automation, whereas SMEs end up with solutions that are less effective and more
                  expensive.</li>
                <li>With minimal competitive pressure, companies need not rush innovations to market. They can take time
                  to
                  implement automated processes before launching new products or services, thereby reducing the
                  potential
                  for
                  job creation that might come from a more immediate rollout.</li>
                <li>Companies focus more on appealing to investors than on attracting customers or employees.
                  Consequently,
                  they streamline production and automate jobs to cut costs, which boosts investor confidence but curbs
                  overall job growth.</li>

          <h1>Patent Problem #15: Vicious Cycles in Education</h1>
          <div>
            One part of the task and job creation/destruction diagram left to be analyzed in depth is the role of
            Education
            in creating employment.

            <img src="images/education.png" />

            <p>Although people often assume that workers need Education to fill job openings, it is equally important
              for
              companies to gain knowledge, skills, social capital, and a form of meta-Education that enables them to
              spot
              and pursue market opportunities. Organizations must understand relevant technologies, consumer needs,
              and
              industry trends, as well as design and manufacturing processes. In addition, they must form
              relationships
              with
              suppliers, distributors, and recruiters to ensure a strong market presence. A company’s ability to
              assess
              its
              own strengths and weaknesses is critical for staying competitive.</p>

            <p>However, in markets dominated by oligopolies that rely on patent power, most companies cannot reach the
              level
              of institutional maturity needed to recognize and act on new opportunities. Furthermore, employees
              require
              proper training so they can help their organizations adapt and innovate. This emphasizes that Education
              is
              essential for both individuals and companies.</p>

            <article class="alert alert-primary">
              <h1>Key Concept: Education sources</h1>
              <div>
                <p>Education can be obtained from roughly two sources:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><b>Formal Education:</b> through structured and recognized institutions such as schools, colleges,
                    universities, and specialized training programs. This includes traditional pathways like
                    classroom-based
                    learning and more modern approaches, such as online courses, webinars, and e-learning platforms.
                    These
                    programs typically follow standardized curricula and often lead to degrees, diplomas, or
                    certifications.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Experiential Education:</b> happens naturally through day-to-day work. It’s about tackling
                    tasks,
                    solving problems, and navigating business challenges in real-time. People grow by observing and
                    collaborating with peers, acquiring tacit knowledge, receiving guidance and feedback from managers
                    and
                    seniors, and tapping into
                    company resources like training programs, knowledge-sharing sessions, and documentation. It happens
                    on
                    informal moments too—discussions with coworkers, team projects, and cross-functional collaborations.
                    Crucially, it includes exposure to customers, their needs, assumptions, and challenges, offering
                    invaluable insights that shape both professional growth and business success.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </article>

            <p>The patent system blocks individuals and companies from obtaining Education via two vicicous cycles:
            </p>

            <blockquote>THE FIRST VICIOUS CYCLE IN EDUCATION: YOU CANNOT GET A JOB BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT
              EDUCATION, AND YOU CANNOT GET THE RIGHT EDUCATION BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE A JOB.</blockquote>

            <p>When employed, a person receives experiential Education that enables them to continue gaining
              market-relevant
              knowledge, skills, social capital, and meta-Education. Moreover, with sufficient income they can afford
              a
              formal Education for themselves and for their families.</p>

            <p>The oligopolies created by the patent system, however, limit company and job creation in
              various industries, thus preventing individuals from getting hired and, as a result, from receiving
              experiential Education or from earning enough money to afford a formal Education.</p>

            <blockquote>THE SECOND VICIOUS CYCLE IN EDUCATION: WITHOUT EDUCATION, YOU CAN’T BECOME AN INNOVATOR,
              ENTREPRENEUR, OR CONSUMER. THE RESULTING DECREASE IN INNOVATIONS, IN COMPANY COMPETITION, AND IN MARKET
              DEMAND
              WILL REDUCE JOB CREATION, FURTHER REDUCING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATION.</blockquote>

            <p>This vicious cycle is more indirect, nuanced, and insidious than the first one, as it operates in three
              ways:</p>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The lack of Education reduces the number of potential innovators, as they are blocked from being
                Diffusers, and later on participating in other parts of the innovation cycle, which will then reduce
                the
                number of inventions, reducing Breakthroughs, Complexity, Obsolescence, and Trends</li>
              <li>There are fewer entrepreneurs, and thus fewer new companies being founded, resulting in diminished
                business growth, causing a decrease in competition</li>
              <li>With fewer businesses, there are fewer employed workers, and thus fewer consumers with money to
                spend,
                causing a decrease in demand</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These three factors reduce the number of jobs being created, so even fewer workers and companies end up
              receiving experiential Education and formal Education. This perpetuates the second vicious cycle in
              Education.
            </p>

            <p>By abolishing the patent system, the harmful cycles it creates can be reversed, paving the way for
              virtuous
              cycles fueled by broader involvement in technological development. Once people are free to work with any
              technology, more jobs emerge, which in turn provide both individuals and companies with the Education
              needed
              to innovate, launch businesses, and become active consumers. This vibrant economy then generates even
              more
              opportunities. Past examples from regions that partially or largely disregarded their patent systems
              have
              demonstrated great success, as explored in depth in the history section of this book.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-15">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The patent system blocks individuals and companies from obtaining both experiential and formal
              Education,
              preventing them from taking advantage of opportunities that do exist (jobs or market opportunities).</p>
            <p>The patent system also prevents individuals and companies from participating in the economy, as
              consumers
              that create demand, as entrepreneurs that create supply, and as innovators that accelerate teh
              innovation

          <h1>Patent Problem #16: Carrot Without a Stick</h1>
          <div>

            <p>Many economists argue that patents bring short-term problems but offer long-term benefits by creating
              innovations that help society overall. However, this view overlooks the serious downsides caused by
              patents,
              and it overestimates the supposed long-term gains from inventions driven by flawed or obsessive
              incentives.
              It
              also ignores the lack of motivation to implement (Introduction and Diffusion) those inventions once a
              patent
              is awarded.</p>

            <blockquote>THE PATENT SYSTEM HEAVILY INCENTIVIZES THE ACT OF INVENTING, BUT LACKS CORRESPONDING
              INCENTIVES
              TO
              TRANSLATE THOSE INVENTIONS INTO REALITY (IMPLEMENTATION) ONCE A PATENT IS GRANTED, FOR THE BENEFIT OF
              THE
              POPULATION. IT’S A CARROT WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING STICK.</blockquote>

            <p>Some people assume that the promise of profit alone will lead patent holders to use or license their
              inventions, but that assumption is naive. Real market pressure, which pushes companies to act quickly
              and
              completely when they see a chance to profit, only happens in a free market. Patents create a temporary
              monopoly that removes the fear of competition, which is a vital force in any healthy economy. A
              combination
              of
              profit incentives and the threat of competition is necessary for companies to make the best choices, yet
              the
              patent system weakens that balance.</p>

            <p>Many problems arise when individuals or companies feel entitled due to a monopoly, such as a patent.
              This
              sense of comfort often leads them to stay within safe and familiar territories, even when there is
              profit
              to
              be earned and society would benefit if the company expanded its reach. Building new facilities or
              entering
              unfamiliar legal environments requires a lot of time and energy, and leadership may decide to focus on
              easier
              returns or enjoy existing profits instead. Ralph Nader's research on the automobile industry shows how
              this
              attitude can harm progress.</p>

            <p>Companies sometimes place too much faith in poor investments, media hype, or unreliable promises from
              partners or government agencies, which causes distractions, delays, and missed openings for growth.
              Corporations can also suffer from fear, ego, prejudice, depression, short sightedness, hubris, and
              laziness.
              Failure can create a fearful mindset, limiting fresh investment, while success can feed arrogance and
              discourage cooperation with smaller or more challenging ventures. Internal disputes, such as corporate
              divorces, drag out conflicts and freeze projects that might otherwise move a company forward.</p>

            <p>Ideas alone have no direct benefit. They must be implemented into real products or services that can
              feed
              people, heal illnesses, or help machines run more effectively. The question is how much the stick, or
              fear
              of
              competition, matters compared to the carrot, or profit. According to Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's
              work
              in Prospect Theory, loss aversion shows that the fear of losing is about twice as strong as the appeal
              of
              winning. This means that without the stick of real competition, patent holders have much less reason to
              turn
              their inventions into reality.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-16">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Abolishing patents would allow multiple businesses to use the same invention, creating a market where
              competitors push one another to act. By removing monopolies, job creation and innovation would increase,
              because if one firm fails to put an invention to use, another will.</p>

          <h1>Patent Problem #17: Not Designed to Incentivize Inventions</h1>
          <div>

            <p>The roots of the modern patent system go back to Venice in 1474, whose patents lasted only ten years,
              and
              more importantly, rather than aiming to spark new inventions, these patents were designed to attract
              foreign
              artisans (specialists) who already had inventions or special skills. By granting them monopolies on
              their
              products, Venice encouraged these artisans to move there, bringing economic growth and fresh expertise
              during
              a time of constant wars, unsafe roads, and slow travel between major European cities. This early patent
              system
              spread from there as artisans migrated to other regions and asked for similar protective rules.</p>

            <img src="images/innovation_cycle.png" />
            <p>From the perspective of the Innovation Cycle, patents were originally designed to incentivize
              <b>Introduction</b>, the first phase of implementation. Once certain inventions were well established
              abroad
              and government leaders became aware of their market value, the leaders granted temporary monopolies to
              foreigner artistans so they would come and <b>introduce</b> already existing inventions there. The
              leadership
              did not care who the original inventor was, only that the invention was introduced locally by someone.
              From
              there, the patent system spread, and was implemented at bigger scales, reaching national levels across
              continental europe, England and United States, always with the focus on introducers’ patents.
            </p>

            <p>The shift toward granting patents to original inventors was gradual, becoming widespread in the United
              States
              and Europe between the late 1800s and early 1900s. This occurred nearly four centuries after Europe
              established its earliest patent systems and after the use of introducers’ patents powered these nations
              through the Industrial Revolution. We explore this transition further in the book’s history section.</p>


            <p>Although early introducer patents might appear primitive, they were actually an accidental stroke of
              genius
              because of their elegant simplicity and many advantages, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Easier delineation:</b> Defining the final product as one larger invention, rather than listing
                every
                small invention within it, removed the risk of gridlocks or disputes over lower-level inventions.</li>
              <li><b>Unintentional incentives for Diffusion:</b> Each city-state or country granted introducers’
                patents
                only in its own territory, ignoring foreign patents. This encouraged the spread of inventions across
                regions
                and seas, fueled competition, and strengthened the Innovation Cycle.</li>
              <li><b>Ideosphere growth:</b> Widespread Diffusion helped Education related to new inventions and
                industries
                expand, clearing the path for newer inventions and creating more opportunities for both individuals
                and
                businesses.</li>
              <li><b>Timing:</b> Patents were granted only after an invention had shown real value in the marketplace,
                and
                only if it would not otherwise arrive naturally or quickly enough. This prevented unnecessary
                monopolies.
              </li>
              <li><b>Due process:</b> Rulers awarded patents for valuable inventions only after careful review. If a
                patent
                holder failed to implement the invention, another “introducer patent” could be granted to a different
                artisan who was ready to bring it to market.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As a result, the early patent system’s focus on Introduction offered a far better way to promote the
              Innovation Cycle than our modern patent system, which focuses on Invention. Paradoxically, it was also
              better
              at encouraging inventions themselves—even though that was not its direct goal—because it allowed greater
              freedom to use existing technologies, avoiding many of the problem we are studying, especially the
              vicious
              cycles in Education.</p>

            <p>It is worth noting that even at the end of the era of introducers’ patents, the qualities that once
              made
              the
              system effective had been weakened. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Territorial Limitation:</b> Allowing patents to apply only to small regions encouraged
                competition
                and
                Diffusion. An example can be seen in European city-states or when each of the original thirteen
                American
                colonies had its own patent system. When these systems became national, the monopoly power grew much
                stronger.</li>
              <li><b>Scope of Protection:</b> Even the smallest inventions qualified for protection, causing gridlocks
                and
                difficulties when using lower-level inventions.</li>
              <li><b>Lack of Timing and Due Process:</b> Any invention could qualify for an introducer’s patent,
                regardless
                of local market needs, and without confirming that the invention was actually introduced. For this
                reason,
                these patents were sometimes referred to as “registration patents,” because they required only
                registration
                at the patent office.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Nevertheless, even this weakened system of introducers’ patents was less harmful to the job market,
              innovation, and the economy than the current patent system, as it still allowed Diffusion across
              nations.
            </p>

            <p>The transition from patents granted to introducers toward patents granted to original inventors did not
              arise
              from a careful evaluation of alternatives. Instead, it occurred primarily because it could utilize the
              existing patent-office infrastructure and because it was believed to minimize government intervention,
              which
              is prone to mistakes and corruption — considering that patent holders would profit from their inventions
              in
              the marketplace.</p>
            <p>However, this view grossly underestimates the multitude of decisions that governments (through patent
              offices) must still make, such as defining the boundaries between ideas (prior art or obviousness),
              determining whether an invention works, and ensuring that there is adequate disclosure of how it works.
            </p>

            <blockquote>We have no reason to believe that we need incentives to encourage innovation beyond what the
              free
              market would naturally provide if it were allowed to function normally. <br />
              Even if we decided to promote innovation, there is no scientific basis for assuming that focusing on
              Inventions is the best method. We could instead emphasize Introduction, Diffusion, the Ideosphere, or a
              balanced mix of these elements.</blockquote>

            <p>If society believes that certain inventions, in specific places or times, might need extra incentives,
              prizes
              — whether for the creation or introduction of an invention — can offer a healthier and more effective
              alternative to patents.</p>
            <p>Prizes rely on proper due process, lower stakes, and better timing. Rather than granting exclusive
              rights
              before an invention has proven its worth, a prize system rewards achievements after their success has
              been
              demonstrated. </p>
            <p>Some may argue that governments lack the funds to distribute large sums as prizes, but there are other
              solutions. One involves offering tax breaks to inventors
              of valuable inventions that could strengthen the economy, which might ultimately increase the
              government's
              tax
              income.</p>

            <p>If governments decide against giving financial support in the present or the future, they can still
              leverage
              the element of status. A prize awarded by a prestigious national authority can raise an inventor's or
              company's profile in the market, offering free advertising and greater trust among consumers. This
              status
              could be further expanded if governments required television, radio stations, newspapers,
              online streaming services, and social media platforms to dedicate a small portion of their advertising
              to
              promote the prize-winner. Such exposure would involve no extra cost to the government, while still
              providing
              a
              significant boost to inventors and companies.</p>

            <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-17">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The early patent system was created to incentivize the Introduction of an existing invention, not to
              incentivize new inventions or innovation in general. But due to its brilliant simplicity, it ended up
              being
              a
              better system than the current patent system, avoiding many of the patent problems we are studying, and
              incentivizing innovation. </p>

            <p>Over time, the patent system was changed to incentivize inventions, without a comprehensive review of
              the
              new
              goal, and without a careful analysis of possible alternatives and their pros and cons.</p>

          <h1>Patent Problem #18: The Rise of the AI Inventor</h1>
          <div>

            <p>Advocates claim that the patent system rewards inventors who invest significant time and resources in
              research, using "obviousness" and "novelty" tests that depend on time investment.</p>
            <p>In theory, if research could be done almost instantly—such as in a "research alternative universe"
              where
              learning and experimentation cost no time—standards for what is considered innovative would be much
              higher.
              In today's world, AI has emerged as a powerful tool that can rapidly generate inventions. For instance,
              AI
              has been used to design efficient engine parts and create novel antenna designs that even experts find
              perplexing. Because AI can produce many inventions quickly and inexpensively, it challenges traditional
              notions of invention merit. </p>

            <p>Google used its AI system, DeepMind, to <a
                href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2023/11/29/google-deepmind-new-compounds-materials-project/"
                target="_blank">generate 400,000 new compounds for Berkeley Lab's Materials Project</a>, a project
              that
              seeks new materials for future technologies such as lighter alloys to improve fuel efficiency in cars,
              more
              efficient solar cells to boost renewable energy, and faster transistors for next-generation computers.
              Because each compound or invention can be patented, similar use of AI could allow unethical entities to
              preemptively patent nearly every useful invention, enabling them to control entire industries through
              powerful AI technology.</p>

            <p>The use of AI presents several problems for the patent system. Patent applicants may generate
              revolutionary
              ideas with minimal effort, while the current system already struggles to determine if an invention truly
              required significant human input. One suggested remedy is for patent examiners to use AI themselves to
              test
              the novelty and obviousness of new inventions, yet this approach is complicated by variations in AI
              models,
              the need for specialized training data, and concerns about revealing proprietary methods. These
              challenges
              introduce uncertainty, complexity, and additional costs into the patent examination process.</p>


            <p>Ultimately, the rise of AI inventors marks a significant step in an ongoing journey. Historically,
              large
              and wealthy companies have leveraged the patent system to their advantage—using specialized software and
              teams of experts to create inventions, draft patent applications and secure vast portfolios. AI is a
              powerful new tool to take this pattern to the next level.</p>
            <p> Ironically, despite being a major Breakthrough, AI was developed largely by working outside the
              constraints of the patent system. AI coding and training occur on the "producer side"—on computer
              servers
              where detecting patent infringement is very difficult. This environment allows for rapid iteration and
              the
              free use of technology, pushing the boundaries of innovation even further.</p>


            <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-18">Conclusion</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>AI-driven inventions greatly intensify the challenges inherent in the patent system by making it
                exponentially more difficult to assess the true merit of an invention</li>
              <li>AI accelerates automation, destroying jobs, and with patents already restricting innovation and job
                creation, this will result in a substantial net loss of employment</li>
              <li>Ultimately, AI will expose the flaws in the current patent system and contribute to its eventual
                abolition</li>

          <h1>Patent Problem #19: Superficial Knowledge Disclosure</h1>
          <div>

            <p>Advocates claim that the patent system forces inventors to publicly document how their inventions work.
              This disclosure is supposed to allow others to learn from the invention and, once the patent expires, to
              use
              it without restriction. In theory, this setup increases innovation over the long term, even though it
              may
              slow down innovation during the patent period. However, in reality, the system does not work as well as
              the
              theory suggests.</p>

            <blockquote>PATENTS ARE WRITTEN BY LAWYERS FOR LAWYERS, NOT BY INVENTORS FOR INVENTORS.</blockquote>

            <p>In the United States for example, almost all utility patent applicants use patent professionals such as
              lawyers or agents. These practitioners serve as a bridge between inventors and the patent office. Their
              job
              is not only to secure the patent but also to write the application in a way that is purposely vague.
              This
              vagueness is intended to cover as many current and future technologies as possible.</p>

            <blockquote>PATENTS ARE PRIMARILY A STRATEGIC LEGAL WEAPON, TO BE WIELDED IN MEETING ROOMS AND COURTS
              AGAINST
              FUTURE ADVERSARIES.</blockquote>

            <p>Patent documents include detailed text and diagrams, but they offer far less information than is needed
              for
              a complete transfer of knowledge. Each industry uses its own best practices for teaching technical
              details,
              making it hard for the patent office to require more extensive disclosures. When companies are commited
              to
              knowledge transfer, like training new employees on a mechanical invention, such as a car component, they
              provide much more information than what is found in a patent.</p>
            <p>This training might include recommendations for foundational learning materials (books, videos,
              courses),
              computer simulations that show how the invention works, and detailed guides on potential problems
              including
              failure signs (such as unusual noises, vibrations, or smells) and how to address them. It also covers
              performance under extreme conditions, thorough advice on materials (with advantages and disadvantages),
              up-to-date FAQs, analyses of past failed experiments, and insights into possible future improvements.
            </p>
            <p>This level of detailed, practical knowledge far exceeds the limited disclosures found in patent
              applications.</p>

            <p>The patent system requires that a patent application disclose enough details so that someone skilled in
              the
              field can make and use the invention without needing to experiment extensively. However, compared to the
              in-depth training provided to new employees—for instance, the comprehensive explanations on mechanical
              components—the information in patent applications is, unsurprisingly, superficial.</p>
            <p>Readers are encouraged verify it for themselves: search for major patents in their field using tools
              like
              <a href="https://patents.google.com/" target="_blank">patents.google.com</a>. Reviewing these
              applications
              will reveal whether the disclosures are clear and comprehensive enough for an average industry worker to
              replicate the invention.
            </p>

            <p>While simple disclosure may have been acceptable in the past when inventions were less complex, today
              most
              patent disclosures are superficial. This falls short of the foundational agreement of the patent system,
              which is to trade a temporary monopoly for a meaningful and useful public disclosure.</p>

            <article>
              <h2>Incentive to superficially read previous patents</h2>
              <div>
                <p>The complex and vague language in patent documents—written mainly by lawyers—makes it hard for
                  companies
                  to
                  assess whether they might later be accused of willful infringement, a charge that can lead to huge
                  damage
                  awards. Some companies tried to avoid this risk by adopting a policy of "willful blindness,"
                  instructing
                  employees not to look up existing patents so they could later claim ignorance. </p>
                <p>However, a <a href="https://casetext.com/case/motiva-patents-llc-v-sony-corp-1" target="_blank">2019
                    court
                    ruling</a> found that such a policy may itself count as willful infringement. As a result, companies
                  now
                  usually perform only superficial patent searches. These limited reviews aim to provide enough evidence
                  to
                  show that willful infringement was not intentional, even if they miss some potential infringements.
                  Overall,
                  this discourages thorough study of patent documents, undermining the patent system's promise of
                  transparent
                  knowledge sharing.</p>
                <h2>Why are there no patent and license auctions?</h2>

                <p>The patent disclosure theory suggests that every patent contains all the details needed to replicate
                  an
                  invention, which should, in theory, support a healthy auction market. Such a market would let
                  companies
                  sell
                  or license patents easily, turning them into invention factories or quick sources of funds in times of
                  need.
                  However, in practice, no thriving patent auction market has emerged. For example, a 2006 patent
                  auction
                  by
                  Ocean Tomo saw only 26% of 394 patents sold, with most fetching very modest prices.</p>

                <p>The main reason for this failure is that patent documents do not capture all the necessary
                  information
                  about an invention. Some details are withheld as trade secrets, considered common sense by the
                  inventors,
                  or
                  omitted to avoid harming a company’s reputation. Genuine technology transfer, by contrast, requires
                  extensive negotiations, detailed documentation, simulations, and personal interactions—not merely what
                  is
                  written in a patent.</p>

                <p>This gap shows that the promised benefit of public knowledge disclosure in patents is far from being
                  realized, undermining the claim that invention disclosure is a saving grace for the patent system.</p>

              <h2>No way to measure patent quality </h2>
              <div>
                <p>Industry and government methods for gauging patent quality do not rely on the detailed disclosure
                  within
                  a
                  patent application. Instead, they use external and subjective measures such as citation counts (both
                  inbound
                  and outbound, as well as citations in scientific literature), litigation outcomes, and the number of
                  companies that choose to license the patent. These methods are prone to manipulation—citations can be
                  faked,
                  and litigation outcomes may reflect high costs and settlement pressures rather than true patent
                  strength.
                  Licensing may also be forced under threat, not necessarily reflecting a patent's inherent quality. In
                  summary, because knowledge disclosure in patents is neither uniform nor strictly enforceable, the
                  quality
                  of
                  an invention cannot be assessed based solely on the patent's content, or any other method.</p>

              <h2>Open sourcing</h2>
              <div>

                <p>The patent system requires inventors to disclose how their inventions work, yet in practice, this
                  disclosure is often minimal and ineffective. In contrast, many for‐profit companies voluntarily
                  open-source
                  their technologies, offering detailed and high-quality information.</p>

                <p>For example, projects like <a href="https://source.android.com/" target="_blank">Google's
                    Android</a>,
                  <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">LinkedIn's Kafka</a>, <a
                    href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Canonical's Ubuntu linux distribution</a>, and <a
                    href="https://spark.apache.org/" target="_blank">Databricks' Spark</a> provide extensive technical
                  details and many projects even allow
                  others to "fork" their projects—using and improving the technology without sharing back or paying
                  royalties.
                </p>

                <p>Ineffective mandatory disclosure versus effective voluntary disclosure. What explains this
                  contradiction?
                </p>

                <p>This contradiction arises because companies gain significant benefits from voluntary disclosure. By
                  openly
                  showcasing their expertise, they attract potential employees, investors, suppliers, and customers,
                  which
                  is
                  especially valuable in competitive fields. Open sourcing also helps develop an ecosystem where others
                  can
                  build on the technology, contributing to improvements and broader adoption. Finally, open projects
                  facilitate industry standardization, creating a beneficial lock-in effect that reinforces their market
                  position.</p>

                <p>Some companies use open-source projects as side initiatives that bolster their ecosystem rather than
                  serving as direct or meaningful revenue sources. For example, Google benefits from offering Android to
                  increase user access, and LinkedIn gains by enhancing its platform with Kafka. </p>
                <p>Other firms, such as Canonical with Ubuntu and Databricks with Spark, center their core business on
                  open-source projects. These companies generate revenue in multiple ways. They may sell newer versions
                  while
                  open-sourcing older ones, create special editions with extra features for large organizations, and
                  build
                  marketplaces for third-party add-ons. They also offer cloud services, paid support, consulting,
                  training,
                  and certification programs, as well as exclusive add-ons.</p>

                <p>Some people think that only software products can be open-sourced for profit, but that is not true.
                  <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino, an open-source electronics platform by
                    Arduino
                    LLC, is a good example</a>. Arduino combines easy-to-use hardware and software, and the company
                  benefits
                  financially in many ways from its open-source model. Its products are used by major companies. For
                  instance,
                  BMW uses Arduino in some of its prototyping phases to develop new features for vehicles, and Philips
                  incorporates Arduino into the development of health-monitoring devices and smart lighting systems.
                </p>

                <p>A competitive free market creates stronger incentives for openly sharing Education about inventions,
                  which
                  accelerates economic benefits for individuals, companies, and society. Education in this context
                  includes
                  not only the transfer of technical knowledge—such as instructions, documentation, expertise, and Q&A
                  support—but also the development of practical skills and social capital through real-world practice
                  and
                  ongoing learning.</p>

                <blockquote>BY FREELY SHARING KNOWLEDGE, OPEN SOURCING COMPANIES GAIN SKILLS, SOCIAL CAPITAL AND META
                  EDUCATION.</blockquote>

                <p>In a world without patents, even if no company deliberately open-sourced its products, the high
                  frequency
                  of simultaneous inventions would allow many workers to learn the latest technologies. By contrast, the
                  current patent system restricts access to certain technologies by allowing only a few companies to
                  work
                  with
                  them, thus limiting the Education that workers receive in these fields.</p>

          <h1>Patent Problem #20: The Power of Constitutional Amendments without Due Process</h1>

          <div>

            <p>The patent office wields immense power over both the national and global economy, yet most people do
              not
              fully grasp this influence. This power is initially exercised when patent examiners and courts decide if
              an
              invention is obvious or if it overlaps with earlier ideas. However, determining these boundaries is
              highly
              subjective, much like the challenge of defining what constitutes acceptable artistic expression versus
              obscenity.</p>
            <p>Overzealous judgments in ordinary situations — such as individual cases of obscene or offensive speech
              —
              often have minimal societal impact, generally leading to fines or brief jail time for the offenders.
              However, such decisions that can alter societal guidelines will trigger extensive conversations in such
              venues as the media, scholarly journals, and legislative hearings and a gradual escalation through legal
              proceedings, often reaching the Supreme Court over time. In other words, proper due process is in place.
            </p>
            <p>The process of reviewing and granting patents lacks the rigorous safeguards that other areas of law
              enjoy,
              despite its far-reaching effects on innovation and the economy. For some perspective:</p>

            <blockquote>THE USPTO GRANTED <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/us_stat.htm"
                target="_blank">3.2 PATENTS PER MINUTE</a> THAT THEIR OFFICE WAS OPEN IN 2020 *. EACH PATENT
              APPLICATION
              WIELDS THE POTENTIAL TO EITHER CREATE OR DESTROY COMPANIES AND ENTIRE INDUSTRIES. DESPITE THIS
              SIGNIFICANT
              IMPACT, THE AVERAGE TIME ALLOCATED TO EACH PATENT IS A MERE 19 HOURS, AND MOST PATENTS ARE ANALYZED BY
              ONLY
              ONE OR TWO EXAMINERS.</blockquote>

            <footer>* Calculated by dividing the total number of patents (of all types) in a year by the total time
              the
              USPTO was open for business in 2020, assuming eight hours per day over 252 workdays</footer>

            <p>The brevity of the patent examination process raises concerns about the depth of research, judgment,
              and
              oversight involved. Patent decisions are made quickly, despite the significant economic consequences
              they
              carry. This fast pace of decision-making contrasts sharply with the profound impact that patents have on
              innovation and the broader economy.</p>

              <h2>Worse than the nationalization of industries</h2>
              <div>
                <p>The power of patents resembles that of nationalizing an entire industry—such as Mexico did with oil
                  in
                  1938
                  or Britain with steel in 1950. Economists generally agree that placing an entire industry under one
                  entity
                  is a poor idea. Nationalization, though extreme, is less so than patents for several reasons:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>When an industry is nationalized, it is controlled by a government that is at least partially
                    democratic. This allows citizens to demand that the industry be managed for the public good,
                    including
                    job
                    creation and innovation.</li>
                  <li>Nationalization usually involves some form of financial compensation to the previous owners or
                    shareholders. In contrast, when patents transfer an entire industry to a company or oligopoly, many
                    smaller companies lose their business models without any compensation.</li>
                  <li>Nationalization only applies within one country, leaving room for competition in the global
                    market.
                    By
                    comparison, patents effectively grant global control over an invention.</li>
                </ul>

              <h2>Patent office production line</h2>
              <div>

                <p>Patent offices often process so many applications that they have function like a factory production
                  line,
                  leaving little time for thorough analysis. This high-volume, assembly-line approach creates
                  significant
                  challenges for the staff, a sentiment frequently expressed by patent examiners. Platforms like
                  Glassdoor

              <h2>Absurd performance targets</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Patent examiners face increasing performance targets over the years, even though inventions are
                  growing
                  in
                  complexity. This situation makes little sense because every patent application theoretically involve
                  unknown
                  unknowns—ideas that have never existed before—yet examiners are expected to finish each case within a
                  roughly fixed timeframe.</p>
                <p>By contrast, in medicine, doctors deal with a much problem, known unknowns: patients often have
                  ailments
                  documented in medical literature. Even so, doctors also have unlimited time for multiple consultations
                  or
                  can refer patients to specialists. Patent examiners do not enjoy these options even while dealing with
                  harder challenges.</p>

                <p>Patent offices impose performance targets to guide decisions on promotions, raises, and hiring. They
                  also
                  need to provide transparency to taxpayers. However, such targets assume clear and easily measured
                  tasks,
                  which do not reflect the subjective nature of analyzing entirely new inventions. This misalignment
                  leaves
                  examiners feeling rushed and undersupported. Frequent IT outages at agencies like the USPTO add to
                  their
                  stress.</p>

                <p>In essence, the root of the problem is the subjectivity inherent in the patent system itself.
                  Requiring
                  examiners to manage unknown unknowns with rigid performance metrics is absurd, and creates an
                  environment
                  where thorough and careful evaluation is almost impossible.</p>
                <h2>Corruption</h2>

                <p>Patent offices wield significant influence over companies and entire industries. The sheer volume of
                  applications, frequent interactions between examiners and applicants, the high economic stakes, and
                  the
                  subjective nature of decisions create a prime environment for corruption.</p>
                <p>Other government agencies with less authority and scope, but more oversight have experienced
                  corruption,
                  so
                  one would expect such occurrences to surface in patent offices as well. However, few cases have ever
                  been
                  prosecuted worldwide.</p>
                <p>This leaves only two possibilities:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The creation of an unprecedented miracle in which a government agency becomes immune to
                    corruption—and
                    we should immediately summon the media and scientific community to study and replicate this unique
                    phenomenon.</li>
                  <li>Corruption does exist, but it goes unpunished due to the subjective nature of the decision-making
                    involved. Detecting, let alone proving, the inappropriateness of any patent decision is extremely
                    challenging.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is for the reader to decide which explanation seems more plausible.</p>
              </div>
            </article>

            <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-20">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The patent system entrusts too much power to the patent office—power that is comparable only to that of
              constitutional amendments, yet it lacks the necessary due process to balance such authority. Patent
              examiners work under difficult conditions and are forced to meet absurd performance targets. This
              environment creates a massive risk of mistakes and corruption, which can negatively impact companies,
              entire
              industries, and even the economies of entire countries and the world.</p>

          <h1>Patent Problem #21: Inventions and Scarcity</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Before diving more deeply into patents, it is important to step back and examine the core problem: Are
              inventions truly scarce? And, if so, what is the nature of this scarcity, and are patents the right
              solution
              for decreasing scarcity?</p>

            <p>This brings us to an interesting paradox: While ideas are limitless, inventions are limited. To fully
              understand innovation, we must first grasp this paradox and the nature of scarcity.</p>

            <article>
              <h2>Physical ideas</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Ideas may seem limitless, but real-world limitations often stop them from becoming actual inventions.
                  Even
                  assembling something as seemingly simple as Ikea furniture can turn into a time-consuming puzzle. The
                  key
                  lies in following a carefully crafted guide that takes reality's limits into account. Creating
                  something
                  more advanced, such as a mechanical device, a life-saving medication, or a machine that thinks,
                  usually
                  involves countless dead ends. Thomas Edison, for example, tested 3,000 light-bulb ideas before finding
                  the
                  right design.</p>

                    <p>Truly viable inventions are rare because they must satisfy many different “laws” of reality, such
                      as
                      physics, economics, and social factors. While each industry and invention faces a unique set of
                      requirements, most inventions must overcome a large number of these constraints. Each category can
                      branch
                      into more specific rules, which further complicates the process.</p>

                <p>Physical Ideas, like vital national resources, are scarce yet profoundly influential. They act as
                  potential
                  bottlenecks that block entire avenues of progress when withheld or restricted. Although they must
                  satisfy
                  concrete physical laws, they also possess the subjective and fluid nature of abstract ideas in a
                  spectrum,
                  making boundaries unclear.</p>

                <img src="images/spectrum_of_subjectivity.png" />
                <p>This dual character helps explain why patents can become so problematic: granting a monopoly on an
                  invention that has few or no practical alternatives means giving one entity control over a crucial
                  building
                  block of progress. Inventing around a patented idea is usually impractical or costly. Moreover,
                  inventing
                  workarounds only because patents demand it diverts attention from solving the next genuine challenges.
                  It
                  makes sense to pursue alternatives when they address real-world needs—such as lowering costs or
                  improving
                  durability—but not when forced by artificial hurdles imposed by the patent system.</p>

              <h2>Horizontal and vertical scarcity</h2>
              <div>
                <p>Societies face two types of scarcity: vertical and horizontal.This distinction applies regardless of
                  the
                  kind of resource in question.</p>
                <p> Vertical scarcity involves how deeply a resource can be tapped until it runs out, which applies to
                  things
                  like oil or minerals. Physical Ideas,
                  fortunately, are unique because they are unlimited once discovered and can be shared without being
                  depleted.
                </p>
                <p>Horizontal scarcity involves finding the same resource elsewhere, such as searching for new deposits,
                  travelling horizontally across the land, when
                  the first one is empty, or searching across the realm of imagination for an idea.</p>

                <p>A single deposit of a vital resource (horizontal scarcity) can lead to monopoly risks, in such cases
                  governments often split exploitation
                  rights, issue permits, inspect activities, cap profits, and sometimes choose public ownership. If
                  these
                  steps are taken for limited resources, they should be considered even more for Physical Ideas, which
                  are
                  much more constraining. Yet patents often grant broad ownership over these ideas. In earlier times,
                  discovering
                  a vein of gold meant owning only that vein, not all the gold in a country. Patents, in contrast, can
                  grant
                  worldwide control of an idea.</p>

                <p>Some claim that if everyone can freely use new inventions, no one will create them. This view
                  mistakes
                  inventions for uniform goods like oil. Each invention is unique, with specific traits and challenges,
                  more
                  like comparing gold to copper than identical portions of the same metal. Granting one party global
                  rights
                  to
                  an invention is as illogical as giving one firm all the gold on Earth to inspire others to find
                  copper.
                </p>

                <p>Horizontal scarcity for inventions appears in how easily the same invention can arise elsewhere. This
                  involves considering how naturally and readily the same inventions can arise in different contexts or
                  locations:</p>

              <div>

                <p>Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired magazine, observed that many important inventions
                  and
                  discoveries throughout history have appeared in more than one place at roughly the same time. He noted
                  that
                  these occurrences stretch back into eras before efficient travel, long-distance communication, or even
                  writing. The reader is highly encouraged to <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/progression-of/"

                    target="_blank">wikipedia's list of multiple simultaneous discoveries.</a></p>

                <blockquote>HISTORY IS FULL OF EXAMPLES OF SIMULTANEOUS INVENTIONS, EVEN IN PREHISTORY, BECAUSE
                  INVENTIONS
                  ARE

                  WITH
                  ACCESS TO A SIMILAR EDUCATION, BY THEIR BEING PART OF THE SAME IDEOSPHERE, OR BY THEIR STANDING ON THE
                  SHOULDERS OF GIANTS – A SCENIUS.</blockquote>

                <p>Genius alone is not the sole engine of great discoveries. This realization should be viewed with
                  optimism,
                  because it shows that humanity is never dependent on a single individual to achieve vital inventions.
                  Even
                  if a talented mind is lost early, others will eventually solve the same problem. At the same time,
                  ideas
                  do
                  not simply arrive on their own. The pace of progress can slow dramatically, as seen during Europe's
                  Dark
                  Ages, which lasted for centuries.</p>
                <p>Shortening that timeline calls for a healthier environment that encourages innovation. Rather than
                  relying
                  on patents or accepting oligopolies, a better approach is to remove barriers and promote as many
                  sceniuses
                  as possible. When more people have access to strong Education and can collaborate freely, inventions
                  will
                  inevitably emerge.</p>

              <h2>Inventions are in the air</h2>
              <div>
                <img src="images/rain_of_inventions.png" />

                <p>Imagine every invention as a helium balloon floating above us, available to be grasped from time
                  immemorial. Once an invention
                  is added humanity's collective knowledge, or Ideosphere, it lifts our collective platform, raising
                  living
                  standards and revealing new inventions more quickly. However, oligopolists restrict access to these
                  “balloons", hoarding them, building patent portfolios that allow them to profit first and block others
                  from
                  exploring the
                  new opportunities.</p>
                <p>In contrast, a scenius fosters open collaboration. Standing on the shoulders of a scenius, a
                  so-called
                  genius jumps higher into the future, speeding up innovation and bringing tomorrow’s discoveries to us
                  earlier. Without patent constraints, more people would gain access to these inventions over time,
                  making
                  them appear obvious in hindsight. Instead of remaining under the control of powerful entities, new
                  ideas
                  would gradually spread, lifting society, strengthening the cycle of progress, and inevitably proving
                  inventions.</p>

                <p>Proponents of the patent system often argue that inventors are creating something that would not
                  exist
                  otherwise (the opposite of inevitable), and that patent incentives are self-regulating, meaning that a
                  worthless invention will fail to make any profits in the market, while exceptional inventions will
                  reap
                  significant returns.</p>

                <p>However, the reality is quite different. Without the patent system, market incentives would truly be
                  self-regulating.</p>

                <p>Exceptional inventions would occur when an inventor creates something well ahead of anyone else,
                  giving
                  them ample time to capitalize on it—whether by establishing a company, forming partnerships, or
                  selling
                  the
                  invention—likely flooding the market before new competitors emerge. In these cases, the inventor would
                  have
                  alternative tools to monetize their exceptional invention, as it should be.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, if an invention is likely to emerge soon, the inventor would not enjoy a prolonged
                  period of exclusivity before competitors catch up. That, too, is exactly as it should be.</p>

                    <b>Inventions are inexhaustible</b>; they are infinitely exploitable. One person using an invention
                    does
                    not prevent others from doing the same. Societies have nothing to worry about in this aspect.

                  <li>
                    Horizontal scarcity refers to the likelihood that the same invention will be created elsewhere.
                    <b>Inventions are inevitable if the right conditions are in place</b>. Sceniuses exposed to the same
                    problem, quality Education, and
                    the freedom to use any technology ensure that inventions will eventually occur, as demonstrated by
                    innumerable cases of simultaneous inventions. Societies should only worry about accelerating this
                    process.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Some people believe that, without patents, there would be a shortage of <b>new</b> inventions.
                  However,
                  this
                  assumption lacks solid proof, as we have seen. Furthermore, granting monopolies over all the sources
                  of
                  an
                  essential invention in the hope
                  of sparking new innovations is a risky gamble. It is like giving away all the world's copper to a
                  single
                  group in exchange for a random metal of unknown value. Most would consider such a deal too risky,
                  given
                  the
                  uncertain benefits and the potential harm to competition and growth.</p>
                <p>Yet, this is precisely what the patent system does: It grants monopolies over scarce existing
                  inventions,
                  in the hope of incentivizing new ones — despite the evidence that the patent system discourages
                  innovation
                  and inventions, and the undeniable fact that the value of these potential new inventions to society
                  remains
                  uncertain.</p>

                <p>The original patent system granted patents to those who introduced existing inventions to new
                  markets,
                  rather than encouraging the creation of new uncertain inventions. This earlier approach was more
                  targeted:
                  it rewarded individuals only after the free market confirmed an invention's worth. Governments
                  understood
                  that known ideas were truly scarce, since transporting them to distant regions was difficult.</p>
                <p>The shift to incentivize the creation of new inventions, rather than the introduction of existing
                  inventions, is one of humanity's biggest unrecognized mistakes.</p>

                <p>By contrast, the modern system prioritizes the creation of new inventions that may not require
                  incentives
                  at all. It also makes proven inventions artificially scarce, gambling on future ideas of unknown value
                  and
                  hindering the Diffusion of existing inventions that have already shown their worth.</p>

                <blockquote>THE ONLY TRUE SCARCITY RELATED TO INVENTIONS IS SPEED: NOT WHETHER NEW INVENTIONS WILL BE
                  CREATED,
                  BUT HOW QUICKLY THEY WILL EMERGE.</blockquote>

                <p>Society should focus on accelerating the natural creation of inventions without harming existing
                  innovation. This means preserving the healthy flow of ideas, rather than creating artificial shortages
                  of
                  inventions that are already effective and abundant. If the goal is to create more inventions, the best
                  approach is to strengthen the Ideosphere. By supporting collaborative environments and improving
                  Education,
                  inventions will emerge naturally, and progress will not be halted by monopolies.</p>

                <p>The current patent system tries to spur new inventions but often does the opposite. It creates
                  scarcity
                  where none should exist, gives technology control to a few large companies, and slows the emergence of
                  fresh
                  ideas. This system restricts innovation, reduces job opportunities, and limits Education. Instead,
                  incentivizing invention ought to include broad access to existing ideas and a supportive environment
                  for
                  new
                  ones, ensuring that one part of the Innovation Cycle is not boosted at the expense of the others.</p>

                <p>If anything needs to be incentivized, it is the speed of the natural creation of new inventions. Like
                  any
                  effort to accelerate processes that already work, we should adhere to the principle of “do no harm”
                  before
                  attempting to make improvements. In other words:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>We should avoid disrupting the natural flow of innovation.</li>
                  <li>We should not kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.</li>
                  <li>We should not kill innovation in the name of new inventions.</li>
                </ul>


                <img src="images/innovation_cycle.png" />

                <p>Society should make certain that every stage of the Innovation Cycle works smoothly. If incentives
                  are
                  needed, they must be applied carefully so that improving one stage does not harm another. For
                  instance,
                  if
                  the goal is to encourage new inventions, the focus should be on strengthening the Ideosphere by
                  nurturing
                  more sceniuses and improving Education, without restricting access to existing inventions.</p>
                <p>Creating artificial scarcity for resources that are both inexhaustible and inevitable is the worst
                  possible choice. It slows progress and undercuts the free flow of ideas, which is essential for
                  genuine
                  innovation and growth.</p>


                <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-21">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The patent system aims to incentivize new inventions but unintentionally discourages them. Moreover,
                  it
                  creates an artificial scarcity of existing inventions. By allowing oligopolies to hoard technology,
                  the
                  system stifles innovation, limits job opportunities, and hampers Education, resulting in a vicious
                  cycle
                  that prevents new inventions from emerging.</p>

          <h1>Patent Problem #22: Creation, Property, and Monopoly</h1>

          <div>
            <p>One argument for patents is that inventors deserve complete ownership of their creations, a view
              sometimes
              called "natural rights." This position claims that controlling an invention is a rightful reward for an
              individual's intellectual work.</p>

            <p>However, ownership is legitimate only if the person legally owns all the inputs used. Most inventions
              depend on public inputs such as shared knowledge, past discoveries, and free insights. Because much of
              the
              process relies on this collective foundation, the final step of assembling an invention should not grant
              sole ownership of what has already been heavily contributed by society.</p>

            <p>The idea of natural rights for inventors never gained much acceptance among economists because it leads
              to
              claims like lifetime ownership of patents, which would harm the economy by restricting use of essential
              technologies. Yet a purely socialist stance, declaring that everything belongs to everyone, is not a
              balanced approach either. Society uses property rights to motivate progress, encourage competition,
              <b>and
                reduce scarcity</b>.
            </p>
            <p>Property rights should only be granted if a resource is scarce, if granting ownership does not create a
              monopoly, if the resource boundaries are clear, and if the owner performed the process independently
              with
              inputs that belonged to them. Patents do not meet these requirements:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Inventions are not scarce, vertically they are inexhaustible, and horizontally they are inevitable
                with
                the right conditions.</li>
              <li>By design, patents give full control over an idea, creating a monopoly.</li>
              <li>Defining boundaries between inventions is difficult, causing legal confusion, conflicts, waste, and
                job
                market problems.</li>
              <li>Inventors rely heavily on publicly generated knowledge and tools. They do not own the long chain of
                discoveries and inventions that led to the final invention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because of these factors and the many other patent problems we are exploring — especially the
              overlapping
              of property rights, resulting in gridlocks — it is clear patents are not a part of capitalism.</p>

            <blockquote>PATENTS BELONG IN CAPITALISM THE WAY EXORCISMS BELONG IN MEDICINE. THEY ARE BOTH PRIMITIVE
              IDEAS
              CREATED CENTURIES AGO, IN LESS ENLIGHTENED TIMES, AND ONLY SURVIVED TO MODERN TIMES BECAUSE THEIR
              THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS WERE NEVER COMPREHENSIVELY QUESTIONED. </blockquote>

            <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-22">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The idea that monopoly over inventions is the “natural right” of the inventor is nonsense. We need to
              abolish the patent system as our first priority, to return to a sane approach to property rights, regain
              economic prosperity, and allow ourselves to tackle humanity's big issues.</p>

          <h1>Key Differences Among Types of “Intellectual Property”</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Some people tie the validity of patents to other areas commonly grouped as “intellectual property”. We
              will
              dispel this serious misunderstanding now. </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.en.html" target="_blank">As Richard Stallman, founder
                of
                the Free Software Foundation, noted</a>: "These laws originated separately, evolved differently, cover
              different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues."</p>
            <p>For this reason, this book intentionally avoids the term "intellectual property," and when its use is
              unavoidable, it appears within parentheses. Let us now study each type.</p>

            <article>

              <h2>Trademarks</h2>
              <div>

                <p>Trademarks identify and distinguish goods or services, covering elements like logos, product names,
                  slogans, colors, and unique sounds. Unlike patents, they do not prevent others from creating competing
                  products or using their own resources. Yet trademarks can be misused, such as Harley-Davidson’s 1994
                  attempt to trademark its motorcycle sound. Courts usually reject these overreaches.</p>
                <p>Compared to patents, trademarks pose an insignificant threat to new ideas, job market, or a balanced
                  economy. They help customers recognize specific brands without forcing competitors out of the market
                  or
                  restricting independent innovation.</p>

            <article>
              <h2>Trade Secrets</h2>
              <div>

                <p>A trade secret is confidential information with commercial worth, known by a select few and protected
                  by
                  measures like restricted access, security checks, and nondisclosure agreements. Company lawyers often
                  use
                  trade secrets to keep research, technical, and business employees from sharing key information about
                  their
                  employer. </p>
                <p>Typical trade secrets include: technology and formulas, algorithms and designs, customer lists and
                  business
                  plans, manufacturing techniques, engineering specifications</p>

                <p>Although many of these could also be patented, trade secrets differ from patents in important ways.
                  They
                  do not
                  require registration, can last indefinitely as long as they remain confidential, and bind only the
                  people
                  who have agreed to keep them secret.</p>

                <p>The key difference is that trade secrets are based on <b>voluntary agreements</b>. For instance, a
                  researcher
                  might sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) in return for a higher salary or company shares. By
                  contrast,
                  patents act as a contract made by governments on behalf of all people, who <b>involuntarily</b>
                  surrender
                  their rights to an
                  invention without direct consent.</p>

                <p>Trade secrets share some problems found in patents—such as the difficulty of defining idea borders or
                  the
                  possibility of fake or obvious ideas—but their voluntary nature limits their scope. Only those who
                  sign
                  a
                  trade secret contract.
                  As a result, trade secrets rarely create oligopolies that harm overall innovation or
                  the job market. Most people remain unaffected, so trade secrets, unlike patents, are much less likely
                  to
                  block
                  widespread progress or severely damage the job market.</p>

                <p>Non-compete agreements, while governed by legal principles different from those for trade secrets,
                  share
                  a key similarity in their goal: to prevent former employers' secrets from spreading to competitors.
                  However, governments often void these contracts to protect the public interest. In 2024, the US
                  Federal
                  Trade Commission banned non-competes nationwide. The Commission <a
                    href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-noncompetes"
                    target="_blank">predicted</a> that this change would increase
                  new business formation by 2.7% per year, creating over 8,500 new firms annually, and boost yearly
                  earnings
                  for the average worker by $524.</p>
                <p>This policy shift offers hope for broader reforms. Non-compete clauses cause limited damage compared
                  to
                  the
                  harm attributed to patents, yet their removal shows how easing artificial constraints can invigorate
                  the
                  economy, encourage invention, spur the growth of new companies, and boost wages. If patents were
                  abolished, one could expect even larger gains in competition, business creation, and worker
                  prosperity.

            <h3 id="conclusion-trade-secrets">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Trade secrets and patents both protect inventions, yet they differ in a key way. Trade secrets emerge
              from voluntary deals between specific parties, allowing their scope to stay limited and any harm to
              remain
              minimal. Patents, on the other hand, are enforced by governments on behalf of entire populations,
              creating
              many problems. Trade secrets, due to their voluntary and narrower reach, provide a net benefit to
              society.

            <h2>Copyrights</h2>
            <div>

              <p>Copyright grants an author the exclusive right to reproduce, adapt, display, distribute, or perform
                creative works. These works can be literary, artistic, educational, or musical expressions. The
                creator,
                recognized as the original source, can transfer or sell this right. Copyright protection lasts for 70
                years after the creator's death.</p>

              <p>Copyrights are the type of "intellectual property" most often compared with patents, yet they are
                <b>drastically</b> different. Given this widespread misunderstanding—and its crucial importance to
                economies—we will carefully explore this subject by investigating the key differences between
                copyrights
                and patents, and by extrapolating how each would function if subject to the same rules as the other,
                all
                while resuming our list of patent problems.

          <h1>Patent Problem #23: The Impossibility of Copyrighting a Single Idea</h1>
          <div>

          <p>Copyright protection applies only to substantial works and requires a reasonable level of creativity.
            In
            other words, you cannot copyright a single idea: you can only copyright a long string of ideas.</p>

          <p>By contrast, patents can be granted for the smallest and most specific individual inventions, and this
            causes many problems. One of them is the difficulty or even impossibility of creating inventions that
            combine various patented technologies, due to the need to negotiate innumerable and expensive licenses.
          </p>

          <p>The enduring popularity of Sherlock Holmes shows why the short string of ideas behind his character
            could
            not be copyrighted, even before the stories entered the public domain. Many creators have adapted or
            reused
            the super talented but misunderstood investigator archetype, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1196946" target="_blank">The Mentalist</a>, centered on a
              revenge-driven consultant partnering with the police</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4052886" target="_blank">Lucifer</a>, a charismatic figure
              assisting with crimes while wrestling with personal conflicts</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2531336" target="_blank">Lupin</a>, a thief seeking justice
              for
              his father’s wrongs</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142" target="_blank">House M.D.</a>, a medical genius
              pushing
              against hospital norms</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          <p>There are many works that follow the Sherlock Holmes pattern, and researchers note that Sir Arthur
            Conan
            Doyle may have drawn on earlier creations. Detective Auguste Dupin by Edgar Allan Poe and Monsieur Lecoq
            by
            Émile Gaboriau both shaped the literary detective template. Authors freely build on these shared ideas,
            yet
            inventors lack this freedom under the patent system. Patents often block even small individual
            inventions
            preventing
            others from combining or refining them without facing major costs/risks.</p>
          </p>

          <p>Most popular stories reuse themes and structures in much the same way that chefs combine basic
            ingredients
            to create different dishes. The Harry Potter series, centered on a young individual with magical powers
            attending a school for the gifted, shares a similar core with tales like Wednesday, Chilling Adventures
            of
            Sabrina, and The Umbrella Academy. In music, the band Axis of Awesome shows how the <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I" target="_blank">same four chords</a> appear
            in countless hit songs, highlighting this widespread sharing of foundational ideas.</p>

          <p>Copyrights protect large strings of ideas. This allows creators to combine elements from existing works
            with their own ideas, fostering a free flow of imagination. By contrast, patents protect individual
            ideas,
            making it difficult to integrate patented inventions into more advanced, higher-level creations— which
            is
            unfortuantely necessary for most inventions.</p>

          <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-23">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>If copyrights worked like patents, they would create overly rigid limitations and problems similar to
            those
            seen in regions that strictly enforce patents. By contrast, if patents followed the model of copyrights,
            innovators would enjoy a much more flexible system. Patents cover even the smallest elements, limiting
            collaboration, innovation, job opportunities and leading to many legal disputes. Copyright, however,
            protects a broader bundle of ideas, lowering the risk of overreach and allowing creators greater
            freedom.

          <h1>Patent Problem #24: No Connection Between Copyrighted Ideas and the Real World</h1>

          <div>

          <p>Copyrighted works—like movies, books, and music—primarily draw from imagination and can ignore
            real-world
            laws. Artists can envision perpetual motion machines, flying humans, or logic-defying events that
            captivate
            audiences without needing to align with any physical or economic constraints.</p>
          <p>By contrast, inventions must adhere to reality, following the rules of physics, economics, and more. A
            so-called invention that breaks these laws proves useless in the real world. This difference explains
            why
            truly viable inventions are so rare, while creative works flourish without facing such barriers.
            Inventors
            must account for every practical detail—such as connectors or vents—or their creations fail. Meanwhile,
            artists can create narratives with plot holes or impossible scenarios that still succeed because their
            core
            is not bound to physical reality.</p>

            <article>
          <h2>Creating bottlenecks</h2>
          <div>

          <p>Granting a copyright on an imaginary element has little impact. At most, it prevents
            others from including the same fictional element in their stories, but they can always substitute
            different
            ideas, even if they are unrealistic.</p>

          <p>In contrast, a patent imposes strict limits on actual, physical resources or methods. If a life-saving
            drug
            is patented, real patients may lose access to effective treatments when rivals cannot use the same
            compound.
            A patented mechanical advance can also block follow-up inventions that depend on it. Unlike fictional
            realms, the real world has no easy replacements for these patented items, and inventing around them is
            often
            impossible. As a result, patents create genuine bottlenecks in innovation, economic growth, and the job
            market, while copyrights have no comparable effect.</p>
          </div>
            </article>

            <article>
          <h2>Dependency on lower-level ideas</h2>
          <div>
          <p>Inventions and creative works both have lower-level ideas, yet they differ in how these ideas become
            part
            of larger creations. When using a patented invention in a new design, it must be physically embedded in
            the
            final product, therefore the innovator usually needs a license
            to use that technology. In contrast, authors and artists often rely on shared cultural knowledge,
            drawing on familiar concepts like elves, dwarves, or faster-than-light travel without copying the exact
            details of existing works.</p>
          <p>This difference shows that inventions are tied to the real world, while creative works remain largely
            free
            from real-world limits.</p>
          <p>Patents, along with trade secrets, involve practical ideas that follow real world constraints.
            Copyrights
            and trademarks deal with expressions and symbols that can exist in the
            imagination. Because patents regulate tangible elements and can block future technologies, they create
            massive concerns for the broader economy. Trade secrets can still be overused, but their impact is
            usually
            more contained and does not affect society on the same scale.</p>
            </div>
            </article>

          <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-24">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Patents grant monopolies over scarce Physical Ideas, which are bound by reality and replacing them is
            difficult to impossible.
            Blocking access to these limited inventions slows progress and raises costs for innovators, who must
            often
            negotiate licenses for even the smallest components. In contrast, copyrighted ideas face no such
            scarcity.
            Authors and artists can leverage or reinvent lower-level creative elements without infringing, granting
            them
            a freedom that patent holders can only dream of. This fundamental difference
            explains why patents can hinder whole industries while copyright protections usually do not create
            similar
            issues.</p>

          <h1>Patent Problem #25: Copyrights and Fair Use</h1>
          <div>

          <p>Copyright law incorporates the "fair use" doctrine, which permits the use of copyrighted material
            without
            the copyright holder's permission, and with no licenses or payments required, for specific purposes such
            as
            criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, search engines, parody, scholarship, or research. This
            doctrine strikes a healthy balance between the needs of the copyright holders and the public interest.
          </p>

          <p>At its core, fair use is designed to <b>create new competition</b>, by helping people gain an
            Education, share knowledge freely, and discuss or critique existing works. In other words, fair use
            creates
            a much needed “escape valve,” letting individuals build on others’ ideas to produce their own, so one
            day
            they will be able to compete in their fields.</p>

          <p>By contrast, patents have no equivalent to fair use. Although anyone can research a patented invention,
            physically using or reproducing it for practical purposes constitutes infringement. This poses a
            significant
            bottleneck for those who need to build upon an invention, including researchers working in different
            fields
            who would benefit from the patented technology.</p>

          <p>The difference is clear when comparing libraries for books (which can be borrowed and studied without
            restriction) to limitations on patented devices, which cannot be freely duplicated or
            used under any circunstance.</p>

          <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-25">Conclusion</h2>
          <div>

          <p>In summary, copyrights offer a generous escape valve through fair use, which allows the free
            utilization
            of
            ideas. This freedom fosters new competition, driving innovation and prosperity. In contrast, patents are
            primarily designed to prevent competition.</p>

          <p>Patents do not have any similar escape valve, and any attempts to create one would severely undermine
            the
            very foundations of the system, as the purpose of patents is to maintain an incredibly tight
            stranglehold
            on
            how inventions are used.

          <h1>Patent Problem #26: Guilty of Infringement Even When Innocent</h1>
          <div>

          <p>In almost all legal areas, you need to intent to do harm to be considered guilty: If harm to others
            happens
            by accident, you are innocent. This common sense policy also applies to “intellectual property,”
            including
            copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets.</p>

          <p>Infringement allegations require proof that the defendant was aware of the existing protected
            information
            and intentionally copied or used it without permission.</p>

          <p>Patent law differs in that infringers can be found liable without intent. People who use a patented
            invention by accident are still considered infringers, even if they never knew the patent existed.
            Because
            innocent infringement is so common, there is a separate category called "willful infringement", which
            covers
            those who knew about the patent and intentionally violated it.</p>

          <p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1270160" target="_blank">Research
              shows</a>
            that the majority of patent defendants are independent inventors unaware of the patents they allegedly
            infringe. Only a small fraction of cases involve intentional copying. Patents mainly grant control over
            simulations inventors, rather than preventing deliberate imitation. </p>
          <p>Changing the law to target only willful infringers would effectively dismantle the patent system, since
            identifying and avoiding all patents is nearly impossible, due to their subjective nature and sheer
            number.
          </p>

          <p>In nearly all other areas of law, unintentional violations do not lead to automatic guilt. A rare
            exception
            is illegal drug importation, which does not justify the extreme stance taken by patent law. Clear
            notices
            and limited legal categories prevent most accidental drug offenses, whereas the patent system
            continually
            adds new patents—about three per minute on a typical workday—making it impossible for innovators to
            track
            all of
            them.</p>

          <p>Envision a situation where governments issue fresh prohibitions as rapidly as new patents, banning
            items
            like strawberry gum one moment and shiny-covered books the next. Travelers would inevitably carry
            hundreds
            of prohibited
            goods without realizing it, turning ordinary people into rule-breakers by default. Patent law does
            something
            similar to innovators: it places them at constant risk of infringing inventions they have never heard
            of.
            This setup disregards the principle that people should not be punished for genuinely unintentional
            violations.</p>


          <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-26">Conclusion</h2>
          <div>
          <p>Patent law is one of the few areas where a person can be found guilty even when they are clearly
            innocent;
            this is by design, as unintentional infringement is the rule, not the exception.</p>

          <p>This creates significant challenges for SMEs, which are likely to infringe on hundreds or even
            thousands
            of
            patents. The only entities that can confidently avoid repercussions are oligopolies, which can deploy a
            Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) strategy to carve out a space where the patent system effectively
            does
            not apply to them.

          <h1>Patent Problem #27: Easy Pirating of Copyrighted Material</h1>          

          <div>
          <p>Even if one were to argue that the issues involving copyrights are comparable to those relating to
            patents,
            a stark difference lies in how easy it is to pirate both. </p>

          <p>Copyrighted items—such as digital files of books, articles, and art—are easily copied to a virtual
            space.
            Ordinary equipment like computers, scanners, and printers (including 3d printers) can duplicate them at
            low
            cost. As
            a result, many individuals engage in casual infringement. Since finding and identifying each person is
            difficult, and the fact that fines are typically
            small, teh result is that the risk for individials is minimal.</p>

          <p>By contrast, patented inventions must exist in physical form, therefore producing them usually requires
            complex,
            costly systems—like factories or specialized manufacturing lines. This makes the infringing party easier
            to
            identify, as often only centralized players can afford or profit from such endeavours, leading to more
            effective enforcement.</p>

          <p>Consequently, copyright infringement
            spreads widely among many infringers who face minimal risk, while patent infringement often involves
            fewer, bigger players who face significant penalties and legal actions. This fundamental difference
            means
            copyright holders, struggling with countless small-scale offenses, rely on occasional, symbolic lawsuits
            to
            intimidate others, whereas patent holders can target a few major infringers with substantial resources.
          </p>

          <p>Since the invention of the printing press, copyrighted works have been easy to copy. Even in
            Shakespeare's
            time, unauthorized printers recreated his plays using actors’ or audience members’ memories and stolen
            manuscripts. This widespread possibility of piracy acts like a check on copyright holders, pushing them
            to
            avoid extreme pricing, distribution restrictions or other abusive behaviours. A clear example is the
            music
            industry’s embrace of the
            iTunes Store after losing sales to Napster and Kazaa.</p>

          <p>By contrast, patents rarely face the same threat of large-scale infringement. Manufacturing a patented
            product usually requires expensive tooling, materials, and specialized knowledge, meaning only a small
            number of companies can replicate it. Because these firms are few in number, they become obvious targets
            for
            patent holders to pursue. This limited exposure to competition via piracy lets patentees preserve high
            prices and engaged in an array of abusive behaviours we have studied. </p>
          <p>While producer-side infringement does happen in factories and on computer servers, it often focuses on
            automation, which reduces jobs instead of creating them.</p>


          <h2 id="conclusion-patent-problem-27">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>In conclusion, even if we consider copyrights to be as harmful as patents for the economy and society,
            the
            ease of circumventing copyrights through piracy makes their overall impact relatively small in most
            areas.
            The negative effects of copyrights pale in comparison to the massive negative consequences of patents.

          <h1>Conclusions regarding “intellectual property”</h1>
          <div>
          <p>The term "intellectual property" covers a range of distinct legal regimes, each with its own history,
            rules, objectives, and economic effects. Among them, the patent system stands out as the major barrier
            to
            innovation, progress, and job creation.</p>
          <p>Some advocates lump copyrights together with patents in academic and policy discussions, but this
            misleads
            the conversation and distracts from the true problem. </p>

          <p>The truth of this difference can be observed in the insurance market. Copyright-infringement insurance
            is
            affordable and widely available because
            it is easier to avoid infringement when following good practices. By contrast, patent
            insurance is rare, expensive, and typically offers only partial coverage.</p>

          <p>Mixing up analysis and solutions across different forms of intellectual property should be avoided, as
            it
            muddles the issues and hinders efforts to address the severe economic issues caused by patents.</p>
