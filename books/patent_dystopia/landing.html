      <p>
        Humanity faces a multitude of challenges, including climate change, economic bubbles and inequality, poor Education , addictions, and many more. But what if the root cause, the hidden constraint, lies not in individual problems, but in the very system that is supposed to encourage progress?
      </p>
      <p>
        This book argues that the patent system - the fundamental principles used by patent laws in every country - while often viewed as a driver of innovation, has instead become a noose around humanity's neck. It strangles job creation, prevents competition, widens inequality, reduces true innovation, and disrupts
        the natural flow of capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first glance, the patent system may seem like a niche topic, but we will explore how it impacts all aspects of society, from cutting-edge technologies to issues that affect our everyday lives, such as the price of tomatoes at the supermarket, the struggles of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), access
        to medicine, and even the broader challenges of Education and national development.
      </p>
      <p>
        While patents may seem like a terribly dry and boring topic, and perhaps a little intimidating, this book skips the irrelevant technicalities and keeps the story engaging and relevant to the average person.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will learn interesting stories and answers to some of today’s most pressing mysteries, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why worker bargaining power and purchasing power are shrinking while inflation rises</li>
        <li>Why we work long hours despite technological advances</li>
        <li>The "productivity paradox," which began in the 1970s</li>
        <li>What all nations that have achieved developed status have in common, including the United States (US),
          Britain, Japan, South Korea, and now the People’s Republic of China (China)</li>
        <li>Why most developing countries struggle to escape poverty</li>
        <li>The unparalleled innovation and good quality in the software industry, compared with other sectors
        </li>
        <li>Why Hollywood became the global center for filmmaking</li>
        <li>What the patent system was originally designed for</li>
        <li>Why companies can get away with planned obsolescence of goods, shelving useful inventions or making
          their
          products impossible to repair</li>
        <li>Why the belief that patents can protect small inventors is a myth, the David vs Goliath fallacy</li>

        <li>Why industries driven by trends, like fashion and interior design, employ so many people</li>
        <li>How the Soviet Union was unexpectedly competitive during the space race</li>

        <li>Why baby boomers rule many countries, even though they are a minority</li>
        <li>Why neoliberal policies in the 90s failed to create competition, leading to markets dominated by
          oligopolies</li>
        <li>The unique success of Israel in replicating Silicon Valley sustainably</li>
        <li>The role of war in reducing inequality</li>
        <li>Why we are stuck in cycles of economic booms and busts</li>
        <li>The phenomenon of "secular stagnation"</li>
        <li>The real reason why deflation is a problem</li>

      <p>
        This book is for everyone. Whether you are a seasoned economist, a policymaker driven by humanitarian goals, an interested citizen, or simply a curious high schooler, these pages offer a compelling case for rethinking humankind’s recent history and the very foundation of innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is an invitation to embrace a bright future in which progress flows freely, unconstrained by the shackles of a system whose time is past.
