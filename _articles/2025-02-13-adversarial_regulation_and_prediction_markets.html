    <p>Government regulation of financial markets is often inefficient and outdated, as evidenced by its failure to prevent major financial crises such as the 2008 Subprime Mortgage Collapse and the 2001 Enron debacle. Despite extensive regulatory frameworks, authorities have repeatedly struggled to detect and prevent even the most blatant cases of mismanagement and fraud.</p>

    <p>Additionally, financial regulation tends to swing like a pendulum, shifting between over-regulation and under-regulation depending on political cycles. With the re-election of Donald Trump in 2025, the trend appears to be moving toward deregulation. In some ways, this shift is beneficial, as many overly restrictive rules have stifled business growth and innovation. However, deregulation also brings risks, such as a rise in scams and financial misconduct, which can lead to innocent investors losing their money and major misallocation of resources.</p>

    <p>Some argue that industry self-regulation could replace oversight. However, self-regulation lacks credibility, as companies and industries have no real incentive to hold themselves accountable. In practice, it often leads to corrupt, opaque systems where businesses prioritize short-term profits over ethical responsibility.</p>

    <p>A more credible approach that has not been fully articulated but has been intuitively and selectively practiced: Adversarial Regulation.</p>

    <p>Adversarial Regulation is a framework that leverages competition, legal systems, and opposing incentives to expose misconduct and enforce compliance. Rather than relying solely on centralized oversight, this decentralized approach incentivizes individuals, groups, companies, and investors to monitor and report problems.</p>

    <p>At its core, Adversarial Regulation is about weaponizing market forces to create a system where bad actors get caught—not because a regulator is watching, but because private parties have an incentive to expose them.  In other words, it incentivizes "snitching" in a way that benefits the financial system.</p>
      
    <p>Several real-world mechanisms already embody aspects of Adversarial Regulation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Whistleblowers</b>: Governments and regulatory bodies offer financial rewards and legal protection to individuals who expose certain kinds of problems.</li>
      <li><b>Bug Bounties</b>: Companies pay ethical hackers to find cyber security vulnerabilities before malicious actors do.</li>
      <li><b>Competitive Bidding:</b> Governments & large corporations request bids for contracts, and companies compete on pricing, innovation, or efficiency. Forces contractors to improve quality & lower costs. NASA’s contracts with SpaceX & Boeing for space travel encourage competition & cost reduction.</li>
    </ul> 
      

    <p>Adversarial Regulation creates a market for transparency by rewarding those who uncover fraud, deception, or rule violations. Key participants include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Investors and Private Investigators:</b> Analysts who profit from exposing fraud before regulators take action.</li>
      <li><b>Competing Companies:</b> Businesses that investigate the misdeeds of their rivals.</li>
      <li><b>Decentralized Watchdogs: </b> Independent journalists, researchers, and open-source intelligence groups that scrutinize companies activities.</li>
    </ul>  

    <p>Adversarial Regulation harnesses competitive pressures and financial incentives to create a dynamic, self-correcting oversight system. This approach is faster, more adaptive, and less prone to regulatory failures. It fills the gaps left by government inaction or inefficiency, ensuring that bad actors are held accountable even when traditional regulators do not act. Rather than replacing conventional oversight, Adversarial Regulation complements it, enhancing market transparency and protecting the financial system and society from fraud, misconduct, and abuse—all while reducing bureaucratic inefficiency.</p>


    <p>In this article, we will focus on one particular form of Adversarial Regulation: <strong>Price Prediction
        Markets</strong></p>

    <p>Prediction markets operate on the principle that a diverse group of individuals, each with a financial stake in an outcome, can collectively predict it more accurately than a handful of experts. Even if individual participants lack in-depth knowledge, the collective wisdom of the market emerges through their financial incentives, as they are compelled to "put their money where their mouth is.</p>

    <p>However, it's important to note that the efficient-market hypothesis, which postulates that asset prices are
      fully reflecting of all publicly available information, is notably false. </p>

    <p>The markets contain all the human flaws, biases and misunderstandings, sometimes influenced by the media and
      society bias and herd thinking, the end result of collective participating is that these issues are average out up
      to a certain point, allowing for better allocation of resources, but still <b>far from perfect</b>.
      That's is good news for investors, who can use their own homework and insights to make their own bets. </p>

    <p>Prediction markets have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market" target="_blank">long and
      fascinating story</a>. Many companies use internal betting markets to forecast product launches, industry trends, and economic shifts. These markets leverage decentralized knowledge and are often more accurate than traditional forecasting models.</p>

    <p>Most existing prediction markets focus on event-based outcomes, such as: Which candidate will win the presidency? Will a military conflict start this year?</p>
    
    <p>Such markets have their uses, but the financial market has special needs, however, when prediction markets are applied to financial assets, they tend to be binary: Will this asset be above $X at a specific time?</p>

    <p>While these binary markets have value, they are too black and white to serve as sophisticated forecasting tools.</p>

    <p>A Price Prediction Market is a <b>purpose-built</b> system designed to create a public market for betting on and predicting <b>future asset prices</b> (e.g., commodities, stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, and their tokens), with <b>minimal undue risks</b>.</p>

    <h1>Why Price Prediction Markets</h1>

    <p>Unlike traditional prediction markets, a Price Prediction Market is designed to generate precise, continuous price forecasts, rather than simple yes/no binary outcomes from ad hoc betting markets. By doing so, it provides real-time, granular, decentralized, and reliable price signals that enhance market transparency, efficiency, and resilience against manipulation.</p>

    <p>The benefits of price prediction markets:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Better Decision-Making for Investors</strong> Investors can consult these prediction markets before investing in an asset and receive real-time updates on changing market sentiment, leading to more informed and lower-risk investment decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Guidance for Everyday Life Decisions</strong> Prediction market signals aren't just for traders. For example, workers considering job changes may use these signals to assess economic stability or the prospects of their new potential employer. If a market crash is predicted, they might delay quitting or opt for job security, while an optimistic outlook might encourage taking more career risks.</li>
      <li><strong>Early Warning System</strong> Regulators, policymakers, and the general public can use these signals as early indicators that a company, industry, or the entire economy is heading in a risky direction.</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic Decision-Making for Business Leaders</strong> Company leaders can use these market signals to gauge confidence in their strategic direction, identifying whether their plans are likely to succeed or fail based on the collective intelligence of the market.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The key reason Price Prediction Markets generate highly accurate signals is that they financially incentivize participants to conduct research. Bettors place wagers in proportion to their confidence in their analysis, effectively turning the market into a decentralized, crowdsourced forecasting system.</p>

    <p>Some may ask: "Why do we need a new system when we already have options, futures, and other derivatives that allow people to bet on future prices?"</p>

    <p>The answer: Existing financial instruments were not designed for price prediction. They were built for risk management, and using them as forecasting tools is an inefficient and unintended workaround. </p>

    <p>Because these tools were originally created to hedge risk for companies in an industry, using them for betting on future prices leads to serious drawbacks. In general, a trader must take on significant risk to place a bet:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At best, they must be overly conservative, limiting the number of bets placed.</li>
      <li>At worst, they become reckless, risking liquidation and cascading market failures if their bets go wrong.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For example, to bet that a stock’s price will drop in the future (short selling), a trader must: borrow shares, pay margin fees and finally risk large losses.</p>

    <p>In contrast, Price Prediction Markets are designed specifically for forecasting asset prices. They enable betting without requiring expensive brokerage services or exposing participants to excessive financial risk.</p>

    <h1>How would a Price Prediction Market look like ?</h1>

    <p>Price Prediction Markets can take many forms, and they will evolve over time, but here is an initial framework for consideration.</p>

    <p>To reduce the impact of volatility, manipulation, and low trading volumes, these markets will likely use Mean Price as the target indicator. We have <a href="../mean_price_and_per_minute_reports">an entire article</a> dedicated to explaining why Mean Price is superior to Last Price and other indicators for this purpose.</p>

    <p>While Mean Price is less volatile than Last Price, it can still experience significant short-term swings. To minimize this, we propose a longer betting period, where participants place wagers on the Mean Price of an asset over an entire month, with settlements occurring on the first day of the following month.</p>

    <p>A prediction market should strike a balance between precision and flexibility. It should not require bettors to predict an exact price down to the cent, where guessing $87.45 instead of the correct $87.46 results in a total loss. At the same time, it should avoid being overly simplistic, where only pre-established price points exist, and the closest guess wins—a flaw in most existing price prediction markets.</p>

    <p>We propose a hybrid approach that allows bettors to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Place bets on an exact price (e.g., $87.45)</li>
      <li>Define a confidence range around that price (e.g., ± $3.75)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This system lets bettors not only express their predictions but also indicate their level of confidence. A wider range signals lower confidence, while a narrower range reflects higher certainty.</p>

    <p>Rewards could be proportional to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How far in advance the bet was placed (earlier bets earn more).</li>
      <li>How close the final price is to the predicted range (a bet that lands at the edge of the range earns less than one near the center).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This approach would create clusters of bets, generating valuable market insights that reflect investor sentiment and confidence levels.</p>

    <p>Below are mock screens illustrating how the user interface might look for bettors and the public.</p>

    <p>Betting markets would offer interfaces for different assets and timeframes, often allowing bets to be placed years in advance.</p>

    <p>As always, the devil is in the details—many complexities need to be addressed, such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What happens if an asset ceases trading due to bankruptcy or low market liquidity? Should the price be assumed zero for betting purposes? Should the bet be canceled, with funds returned to bettors?</li>
      <li>How should early bets be encouraged without completely disincentivizing later bets?</li>
      <li>How can more precise bets be rewarded without discouraging participation?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The exact mechanisms should be the subject of further discussions, studies, and experiments. The goal of this article is not to provide absolute answers at the most detailed level but to start a conversation about these key issues. This article's primary focus is on how Prediction Markets can function on a high level and how they can help society.</p>    

    <h1>Price Prediction Markets Pros</h1>

    <h2>Incentives to monitor and expose problems</h2>

    <p>Price Prediction Markets can serve as real-time intelligence systems, continuously analyzing and exposing systemic risks, inefficiencies, and market failures. By leveraging the collective wisdom of market participants, these mechanisms can identify, anticipate, and potentially mitigate a wide range of problems before they escalate, such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Corporate Deception & Mismanagement</b> – Detecting executive misconduct, accounting fraud, overhyped financial projections, and unsustainable business models before traditional regulators take action.</li>
      <li><b>Market Manipulation & Structural Weaknesses</b> – Uncovering pump-and-dump schemes, artificial price inflation, excessive leverage, and shadow banking risks that could destabilize markets.</li>
      <li><b>Scams and Frauds</b> – Exposing Ponzi schemes, fraudulent ICOs, rug pulls, and misleading investment opportunities that prey on uninformed investors.</li>
      <li><b>Supply Chain Disruptions & Commodity Price Shocks</b> – Predicting critical shortages, logistical bottlenecks, trade wars, and OPEC-led energy price swings before they ripple across economies.</li>
      <li><b>Legal Risks & Regulatory Crackdowns</b> – Forecasting the likelihood of corporate lawsuits, antitrust enforcement, patent disputes, or intellectual property theft penalties that could reshape entire industries.</li>
      <li><b>Non-Compliance with Laws & Regulations</b> – Identifying firms engaging in tax evasion, environmental violations, data privacy breaches, or unethical labor practices before fines or sanctions are imposed.</li>
      <li><b>Social Trends & Cultural Shifts Impacting Markets</b> – Spotting consumer behavior changes, declining demand for legacy industries, and public backlash against companies due to ethical concerns.</li>
      <li><b>Political & Geopolitical Instability</b> – Anticipating government defaults, economic sanctions, civil unrest, and military conflicts that could affect investment flows and global trade.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Even more powerfully, these insights can operate at multiple levels of analysis, providing intelligence that spans:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>Individual companies</b> – Assessing the stability, honesty, and future growth potential of specific firms.</li>
      <li><b>Entire industries</b> – Evaluating the strength, innovation, or decline of sectors like AI, electric vehicles, fossil fuels, or banking.</li>
      <li><b>National economies</b> – Forecasting recessions, inflation risks, currency devaluations, and sovereign debt crises.</li>
      <li><b>Regional or global trends</b> – Predicting macro-level disruptions across interconnected economies, industries, and political systems.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>By incentivizing market participants to identify and act on early warning signals, prediction markets could serve as one of the most powerful tools for regulation, risk mitigation, and economic transparency—reducing the need for reactive policymaking and allowing society to preemptively address threats before they spiral out of control.</p>

    <h2>Funding for Investigative Efforts & Public Interest Research</h2>
    <p>Rewards from Price Prediction Markets could become a powerful funding mechanism for investigative journalism, independent research, and public interest projects, creating financial incentives to uncover the truth in areas that often struggle for funding. Unlike traditional media and research models, which are frequently influenced by advertising revenue, corporate sponsorships, or political interests, this approach would reward accuracy, depth, and verifiable insights rather than content that aligns with financial backers’ agendas.

      <p>By allowing journalists, researchers, and independent analysts to profit from uncovering and exposing real-world risks, this system could disrupt the existing funding landscape and encourage a more fact-driven and transparent approach to reporting. If structured effectively, it could provide an alternative to media business models that often prioritize clickbait, sensationalism, or ideological bias over substantive analysis.</p>
      
      <p>A well-designed prediction market could have, for example, identified the warning signs of Enron’s collapse before the worst happened and regulators stepped in. Participants analyzing financial reports, corporate behavior, and industry trends might have placed bets against Enron’s stability, signaling its weaknesses to the broader market and potentially accelerating accountability before billions were lost. This type of system could serve as a decentralized check on corporate fraud and institutional failures, incentivizing independent actors to expose corruption and mismanagement long before regulators intervene.</p>


    <h2>Accurate Price Discovery</h2>
    <h3>Market Self-Correction</h3>
    <p>Prediction markets can enhance price discovery by leveraging the marginal-trader theory, which suggests that there will always be individuals seeking out places where the crowd is wrong. These traders act as a corrective force, countering market inefficiencies and manipulations by placing informed bets. When the crowd fails or manipulators distort prices, these participants help pull the prediction market back on track, ensuring a more reliable price signal.</p>

    <h3>Confidence in the Market</h3>
    <p>Investors navigating uncertain markets can use prediction markets as an additional source of reassurance when deciding whether to buy or hold an asset. By analyzing the collective sentiment and betting activity, they gain insight into market expectations beyond traditional financial indicators.</p>

      <p>Moreover, while fraudulent schemes can afford polished websites, aggressive online ads, and extensive marketing, they are unlikely to place large bets on their own long-term value at meaningful volumes. A public prediction market would expose this weakness, as assets tied to scams would consistently show low betting volumes and weak market confidence. Over time, savvy investors could consult prediction markets before making financial decisions, reducing the influence of deceptive investment opportunities.</p>
      
      <p>Ultimately, these effects could increase trust and participation in financial markets, making them more accessible and resilient for a broader range of investors.</p>

    <h3>Flexible Risk Management Through Multiple Bets</h3>
    <p>Traders can place multiple bets to hedge risk or to reflect the probability of different scenarios, further enhancing market accuracy and making it a richer source of information.</p>


    <h3>Improving Price Discovery for Illiquid and Emerging Assets</h3>
    <p>Many small-cap stocks, exotic commodities, or illiquid assets suffer from poor price discovery due to low trading volume. Prediction markets could offer an alternative way to determine the “fair” value of an asset, smoothing out erratic price swings and reducing artificial volatility.</p>


    <h2>Better Incentives for Company Leadership</h2>
    <p>Aligning executive and board member incentives with the long-term interests of their companies and shareholders has long been a challenge. Many executives focus on short-term financial performance to maximize their own bonuses, often leaving before the negative consequences of their decisions become apparent.</p>
    <p>One potential use of Price Prediction Markets is to tie a significant portion of leadership compensation to long-term bets on their company’s stock performance. These bets could be structured as multi-year installments, ensuring that executives have a financial stake in the company’s future stability and growth, rather than just short-term gains.</p>

    <h2>Superior Long-Term Investment Forecasting</h2>
    <p>Prediction markets could introduce long-term (multi year) price forecasting, offering less noise and greater precision than traditional stock trading. Unlike daily market speculation, these markets would encourage a long-term outlook, reducing speculation-driven volatility and providing more stable and reliable signals for investors.</p>
    <p>This could be particularly valuable for institutional investors, pension funds, governments, and corporations that rely on long-term financial projections to make strategic decisions.</p>
    <p>For example, a prediction market in 2005 could have signaled Amazon’s (AMZN) future dominance long before mainstream investors fully recognized its potential</p>


    <h2>Public Persona Bets: Enhancing Transparency and Accountability</h2>
    <p>Individuals with potential conflicts of interest, such as politicians, regulators, corporate executives, and financial commentators, could be required—or given the option—to have their bets in Price Prediction Markets made public. This could be done with a delay to prevent immediate copycat behavior while still ensuring transparency.</p>
    <p>Additionally, an AI-powered tracking system could flag contradictions between public statements and private betting positions, helping to detect potential conflicts of interest or unethical behavior in real-time.</p>

  
    <h2>Reducing Financial Fake News, Disinformation and risks</h2>
    <p>Prediction markets could hold company leaders, journalists, influencers, and media outlets accountable for their claims. If a news story confidently states, “Company X will reach $100 per share this year,” but the market overwhelmingly bets against it, readers receive an instant credibility signal. Similarly, when companies make overly optimistic claims about new products or market expansions, futures markets could serve as a reality check.</p>
    <p>By aligning financial incentives with accuracy rather than hype, prediction markets could discourage pump-and-dump schemes, filter out misinformation, and shift market narratives toward truth-seeking rather than speculation. When credibility is directly tied to market expectations, exaggerated claims would become far easier to spot—and far riskier for those making them.</p>

    <h2>Early Warning System for Economic Crashes & Bubbles</h2>
    <p>Prediction markets could serve as a real-time risk indicator for market bubbles, recessions, and banking crises. If too many traders place bets on an imminent market downturn, it would signal regulators, investors, and the public to take preemptive action—offering a far more dynamic alternative to traditional economic forecasting models, which have repeatedly failed to predict crises.</p>
    <p>Unlike centralized institutions such as the Federal Reserve, which often control the financial narrative, a prediction market represents a decentralized risk assessment tool, capturing collective insights that might otherwise go ignored.</p>

    <p>For example, before the 2008 financial crisis, a prediction market on banks that held mortgage-backed securities could have flagged the risks earlier, warning investors and regulators before the situation spiraled into a full-blown collapse.</p>

    <h2>Detecting and Reducing Global Risks</h2>

    <p>Beyond financial markets, prediction markets could provide early detection mechanisms for catastrophic global events, such as pandemics, cyberattacks, or supply chain disruptions. By making these risks visible earlier, societies could take proactive measures to reduce their impact or hedge against potential losses.</p>

    <p>For instance, a prediction market in late 2019 could have shown a higher probability of COVID-19 escalating into a global pandemic, reflected by a drop in airline stock predictions and an increase in demand forecasts for pharmaceutical companies. Such signals might have encouraged governments and businesses to act faster, mitigating some of the worst consequences of the outbreak.</p>


    <h2>Startups and SMEs Public Markets</h2>
    <p>Currently, startups and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) are not allowed to be publicly traded due to the risks involved for investors and the broader market. These risks include low trading volumes, rapid changes in financial conditions, and limited transparency. Such barriers also make it harder for startups to secure partnerships with suppliers, distributors, banks, and other key stakeholders, further complicating their survival.</p>
    <p>However, if Prediction Markets can help meaningfully reduce these risks, the benefits of allowing startups and SMEs to participate in public markets could be transformative—driving more innovation, job creation, and economic dynamism.</p>


    <h3>Solving Low Liquidity Through Tight Trading Windows</h3>
<p>A major concern in opening public markets to smaller companies is low liquidity, which can lead to extreme price fluctuations and poor price discovery. One potential solution is concentrating liquidity in scheduled trading windows.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Startups could trade only on Wednesday afternoons.</li>
  <li>Small companies could trade on Tuesdays through Thursdays.</li>
  <li>Medium-sized companies could trade every weekday afternoon.</li>
  <li>Once a company graduates to large-cap status, it would enter the full trading schedule like traditional public companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>By limiting the frequency of trading, liquidity would be naturally concentrated, reducing price instability while still allowing smaller companies to access public investment capital.</p>

<h3>Investor Education as a Prerequisite for Participation</h3>
<p>A common concern is that uninformed investors might take excessive risks or fall victim to scams when investing in smaller companies. Instead of relying on heavy-handed restrictions, a behavioral economics approach could be used to educate and empower investors.</p>
<p>For example, before being allowed to invest in startups and SMEs, investors could be required to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete an online course on risk management, diversification, and consulting prediction markets before investing.</li>
  <li>Answer a short quiz monthly to maintain their eligibility for placing new investments.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would serve as a gentle "nudge" toward informed investing—providing safeguards without the excessive micromanagement of many existing regulations, such as only allowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accredited_investor"
  target="_blank">Accredited Investors</a> to participate.</p>

<h3>Risk Reduction Through Index Funds & ETFs</h3>
<p>Another way to mitigate risk is by creating index funds and ETFs that hold baskets of startup and SME stocks. Investors would then be able to gain exposure to early-stage companies while still diversifying their risk across multiple businesses.</p>
<p>This approach would:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide a structured way for investors to enter the startup space without betting everything on individual companies.</li>
  <li>Reduce volatility by spreading risk across many smaller firms.</li>
  <li>Encourage long-term investment in high-growth sectors, benefiting both companies and investors.</li>
</ul>


<p>By leveraging prediction markets, scheduled trading, investor education, and diversified funds, the risks of allowing startups and SMEs into public markets could be managed effectively. If executed well, this shift could unlock tremendous economic benefits, creating a more inclusive, innovative, and dynamic financial ecosystem.</p>


    <h1>Price Prediction Markets Cons</h1>  
    
    <p>While these markets offer significant benefits, no system is immune to risks and unintended consequences. Below, we explore the concerns and potential answers in the form of solutions or mitigation strategies to ensure these markets remain fair, reliable, and resistant to exploitation.</p>

    <h2>Manipulation Risks</h2>

    <p>Price Prediction Markets can be vulnerable to manipulation, which might not only distort their internal price signals but also cascade into primary financial markets, misleading investors, policymakers, and businesses.</p>


    <p>Concerns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low liquidity increases manipulation risk – If a market lacks sufficient participants, a single large trader or coordinated group could distort prices artificially.</li>
      <li>Fake scandals & misinformation – Bad actors could plant a fake whistleblower, spread false news, or release fabricated research to mislead traders and profit from manipulated outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Answers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Market Liquidity Warnings & Reliability Signals brokers can help by displaying comparative volume information, and perhaps a reliability signal to warn users of low liquidity.</li>
      <li>Studies <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40268920" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268105001575" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>   suggests Manipulative actions
        may inadvertently enhance market accuracy by motivating informed traders to participate more actively, thereby
        correcting distortions. </li>
      <li>Reduced trading windows for certain markets might be able to concentrate low liquidity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Complexity</h2>
    <p>If the betting mechanism is too complex, mainstream users may not participate.</p>


    <h2>Less predictable</h2>
    <p>
    - Cannot be used to hedge risk in a predictable way
    Options and futures contracts provide a very predictable outcome about the future, at the cost of being very
    imprecise tools to express future believes; however they can provide reliable tools for very precise financial risk
    management.
    Public asset betting markets, as opposite to 1on1 contracts with very precise terms, provide less predictable
    rewards to winners, as new bets can dilute teh winning pool.
    </p>

    <h2>Echo Chambers</h2>
    <p>
    - loop of self-reinforcement once initial odds were measured, like failure to predict Brexit in 2016. However the
    crowd seems to learn, as PolyMarket did correctly predicted Donal Trumps reelection in 2025</p>

    <h2>Prediction marketse lack of crediblity</h2>
    population and goverments see it as gambling
    to be fair, there is an element of luck involved indeed, but that is also true for current futures markets, and for spot trading as well, and we don't dismiss these are economically unproductive.
    - Many countries (like the US), incorreclty perceive prediction markets as online gambling, which is outlawed.
    In July 2003, the U.S. Department of Defense publicized a Policy Analysis Market on their website, and speculated
    that additional topics for markets might include terrorist attacks. A critical backlash quickly denounced the
    program as a "terrorism futures market" and the Pentagon hastily canceled the program.    

    <h1>Uncertainties</h1>

    <h2>The tail wagging the dog</h2> can predictions about the real world, end up driving the real world ? If
    so, can this impact be good or bad ?

    Let's take the example of hwo Price Prediction Markets would interact with Whistleblowers.

    On a good scenario, bettors would encourage whistleblowers, both by obtaining information from them, which they can
    use to place more well informed bets, but also to encourage them to make their information public earlier than it
    normally would.

    But the opposite could also happen, in a bad scenario, where bettors who placed large bets that an asset would have
    a high price during a certain period, but somewhow find out a whistleblowers is about to release information that
    might negatively impact the price, might prevent the whisleblower to go public.

    A potential mechanic that could better align incentives for such scenarios could be the ability to withdraw bets in
    certain scenarios and with some kind of "price" to be paid.

    Perhaps some markets could allow withdrawing, while others wouldn't, allowing users to select what best suit their
    needs, but this could split already low liquidity. Perhaps the same market could allow some bets to be withdrawabel,
    with a penalty to their rewards, while others couldn't.

    For example, perhaps bets could be withdrawn, but only part of it, the closest to the reward time, the less a bet
    can be withdrawn. For example, bets can not be withdrawn in the last month, but for each month before that, they can
    withdraw 5% more, ie: withdrawing 4 months before, will result in only 3x5%=15% of the money withdrawn, and 85% left
    in the pool.

    This would incentivize the market to detect bad practices and encourage public disclosure and whistleblowers as
    early as possible, as they can withdraw ever larger parts of their bets, and replace the capital in newer bets more
    aligned with bad news.

    The impacts on Whistleblowers would of course apply to other kinds of financial information, like market news
    brokers, etc.

    How all these forces will play out in real life, however, is still uncertain.

    <h2>Interactions with other laws</h2> Can Price Prediction Markets negatively interact with other laws and
    regulations ? For example, Whistleblowers are rewarded by goverment agencies for disclosing information, but if they
    are also placing bets in an Price Prediction Market, does that constitute conflict of interest ?
    Perhaps requiring such Whistleblower to disclose their bets would strike a healhty balance.





    <h2>Inflation</h2>
    <p> Bets, specially for the very long term, will be affected by inflation.  Should the prices automatically discount inflation ? If so, by what indicator exacxtly ?</p>

    <p>Not doing so will make a bet simpler, but it will also make bettors bet in two things: both the asset price and overall inflation.
    Doing so will make the markets more complicated, and also introduce subjectvity by the particular choice of indicator.</p>

    <h2>Self Defeating Long term bets</h2>
    <p>It is possible that long term bets might lose because they provide such strong signals that causes changes to happen to the underlying factors that influece asset prices. </p>
    <p>For example: if the market is strongly betting that a company stock will be much less valuable in one year, this might prompt the board to fire the CEO and replace them with someone who can fix problems and create new opportunities, leading the stock to not fall in the future.</p>
    <p>The opposite scenario could also happen, if betting markets predict higher stock values,  the company leadership might consider their current projects and policies enough, not pursuing further initiatives, particularly risky ones, causing the stock value to not rise as predicted.</p>
    <p>The end result might be a that mostly medium term betting markets are effective investments, while other time preference marketes are not as profitable because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>short term prices are unlikely to change much from current prices</li>
      <li>long term prices are too likely to change, in part due to betting markets themselves</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Add on: Information Markets</h1>

    Potential Add On

    A market for information such as company and market resarch can be created as part of a Price Prediction Market,

    - High-skill bettors or independent analysts **research stocks, commodities, or crypto assets**.
    - They **sell their insights or models** to other traders who might not have the time or skill to analyze data.

    **More accurate price predictions**

    (better informed traders = better market efficiency).

    ✔

    **Reduces information asymmetry**

    (lowers the advantage of institutional players over retail traders).

    ✔

    **Incentivizes real analysis instead of pure speculation**

    ### **Creates a Secondary Income Stream for Researchers & Analysts**

    🔹 **How It Works:**

    - Researchers, journalists, or independent traders **earn money** not only from **winning bets** but also from
    **selling reports** to other bettors.
    - This allows **talented individuals** to monetize **valuable insights** without needing a hedge fund job.

    ✅ **Why It’s Useful:**

    ✔ **Encourages high-quality analysis from independent voices.**

    ✔ **Gives non-traders a way to participate in prediction markets.**

    ✔ **Creates a decentralized alternative to traditional financial analysts.**

    - If betting markets **predict corporate failure or fraud**, it puts **pressure on CEOs & board members** to **act
    transparently**.
    - Activist investors **use prediction market data** to challenge bad management

    ntroduces Risk-Sharing & Performance-Based Payments
    🔹 How It Works:

    Instead of charging upfront fees, researchers can offer reports for free but take a small percentage of winnings if
    the bettor profits.
    This aligns incentives between analysts & bettors—researchers only make money if their predictions are correct.
    ✅ Why It’s Useful:
    ✔ Lower barriers for bettors who don’t want to pay upfront.
    ✔ **Encourages analysts to focus on accurate, actionable insights.
    ✔ Creates a competitive knowledge marketplace where only proven researchers thrive.

    **A new industry of “prediction market audits” will emerge** to detect fake bets, misleading reports, and bad
    actors, in the worst case scenairo.

    Good quality analysis can be separated from bad ones with a range of means, for example, from the traditional star
    rating from buyers, to the market publicly displaying the performance of their past bets, to their willingness to
    receive shared revenue from bets instead of upfront paint.

    Risks: fake information and scams, sellers could sell reports saying that a certain asset price will go up, and even
    place a small public bet saying the same; but use another account on the same prediction markert, or another market,
    to bet large amounts of money on the opposite, profiting by misleading people. In the age of computers, internet and
    cryptocurrencies, ensuring the identity of investors is increasingly difficult.

    Insider Trading

    What if someone with insider information sells reports containing non-public material facts, this would be a breach
    of the law. these markets would certainly provide more incentives for this kind of illegal activitiy.

    However, these markets could also serve as a honeypot for regulators, providing a centralized trap where
    investigators know to look for such kind of thing.

    If in the long term, this will provide a net increase or decrease of insider trading, remains to be seen.

    Freely shared information

    It could happen that someone pays for a report or model, but it ends up being leaked freely to the public,
    decreasing the value of the information and bets associated with it. However, this is an existing problem with
    reports produced by financial institutions, and to this day it has not stopped them from this line of business.
    Furthermore, buyers are less likely to leak purchased reports, as it would decrease the value of their own bets, by
    allowing the public to place similar bets.



    Allows Institutional-Grade Research to Enter Prediction Markets
    🔹 How It Works:

    Professional research firms (like Bloomberg, Morningstar, or independent hedge funds) could sell premium research
    inside prediction markets.
    This attracts high-net-worth bettors and institutions into the ecosystem.

    **Makes institutional-grade analysis available to retail traders.**

    ✔

    **Improves prediction accuracy & market efficiency**
