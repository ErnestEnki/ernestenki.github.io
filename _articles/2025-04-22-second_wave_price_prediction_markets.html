      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <div>
        <p>In a <a href="../price_prediction_markets" target="_blank">previous article</a>, we examined why government
          oversight of financial markets often falls short and how Price Prediction Markets can help fill some of those
          gaps. These markets complement the suite of tools societies use to monitor and report problems, alongside
          whistleblowers, short sellers, derivatives, and other mechanisms. We also explored the initial design of a
          Price Prediction Market, analyzing its potential features, advantages, drawbacks, and uncertainties.</p>

        <p>In this article, we will explore how Price Prediction Markets might evolve after a few years, examining new
          features, challenges, and opportunities that could shape their future development.</p>

          <h2>Information Markets</h2>
          <div>
            <p>Price Prediction Markets primary purpose is to monitor and report problems. While they excel at detecting
              risks, their reporting mechanism relies solely on price signals rather than providing full disclosures of
              the
              issues they uncover, as whistleblowers do.</p>

            <p>In the short term, bettors may choose to release reports—similar to short sellers—to inform the market
              and
              align prices with their bets. However, for medium- and long-term predictions, detailed reporting is less
              likely. Revealing too much information too soon could cause immediate price shifts, potentially
              invalidating a
              bettor’s future position.</p>

            <p>To address this limitation and provide additional benefits, an add-on feature could be introduced: an
              <strong>Information Market</strong>—a platform where users can buy and sell reports containing information
              such as raw data, models, analysis, graphs, scenarios and recommendations.
            </p>


            <p>In an Information Market, high-skill bettors and analysts conduct in-depth research on assets and sell
              their
              insights to other traders who may lack the time or expertise to analyze data themselves.</p>
            <p>While independent market analysis services already exist, integrating an Information Marketplace directly
              into Price Prediction Markets offers <b>unique and powerful synergies</b>.</p>

            <p>To foster trust and encourage high-quality research, the platform could implement key reputation features
              for
              report sellers, helping buyers assess credibility before making a purchase. These features could include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Verified Identity</strong> – Sellers can choose to verify their identity, increasing trust and
                transparency.</li>
              <li><strong>Biography</strong> – Sellers may provide background details such as expertise, experience, and
                areas of focus.</li>
              <li><strong>Buyer Ratings</strong> – Traditional star ratings and reviews from previous buyers help signal
                reliability and quality.</li>
              <li><strong>Betting Performance</strong> – An aggregate accuracy score based on the seller’s past bets
                demonstrates their track record and competence in market predictions.</li>
              <li><strong>Current Bet Disclosures</strong> – Sellers could disclose select details of their active bets,
                proving they personally believe in their own reports and reducing conflicts of interest.</li>
              <li><strong>Collateral</strong> – Sellers can lock up a portion of their own funds before publishing a
                report.
                If their reports are flagged as misleading or low quality, they forfeit the locked funds, discouraging
                bad
                actors.</li>
              <li><strong>Gamification</strong> – Introduce rankings, badges, and rewards to incentivize high-quality
                reports and recognize top analysts.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The platform could offer multiple ways for users to purchase reports, allowing for flexibility in
              pricing,
              access, and incentive alignment. Potential models include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Direct Purchase</strong> – Users buy the report at a fixed price, gaining immediate access to
                its
                contents.</li>
              <li><strong>Dynamic Pricing</strong> – Report prices automatically adjust based on different factors:
                <ul>
                  <li>Over time – Buying earlier is more expensive, incentivizing early access.</li>
                  <li>In relation to an asset or its prediction price – If the report appears to influence the market,
                    or if
                    markets begin moving in the predicted direction due to external factors, the report price increases
                    dynamically. This ensures that early buyers gain an advantage while later buyers pay a premium for
                    valuable insights that are proving accurate.</li>
                  <li>In response to demand – Prices fluctuate based on the number of users interested in the report.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Exclusive Early Access</strong> – A limited number of reports are sold early at a higher
                price,
                allowing early buyers to allocate their bets. Later, the report is made available to everyone at a lower
                price.</li>
              <li><strong>Auction</strong> – A limited number of reports are sold via auction, raising prices and
                restricting access, preserving a competitive edge for buyers.</li>
              <li><strong>Profit-Sharing Model</strong> – Reports are free to access, but the seller takes a percentage
                of
                the buyer’s winnings if the bet proves successful. This aligns incentives, ensuring analysts profit only
                if
                their insights are accurate.</li>
              <li><strong>Consultation</strong> – Buyers can pay for additional time with the seller to ask questions,
                request clarifications, or gain deeper insights beyond the written report.</li>
              <li><strong>Subscription Model</strong> – Instead of one-time purchases, users can subscribe to trusted
                analysts for regular updates. Subscription tiers could offer different levels of access, including more
                detailed reports or early releases.</li>
              <li><strong>Commission-Based Reports</strong> – Traders can commission reports from analysts they trust,
                ensuring tailored research specific to their needs.</li>
              <li><strong>Crowd-Funded Reports</strong> – Groups of traders pool funds to commission a report, which is
                later made publicly available.</li>
              <li><strong>Sponsored Reports</strong> – Organizations can commission reports, potentially contributing
                their
                own data to the analysis. They may later resell or publicly release the report to influence market
                perception.
                <ul>
                  <li>A company could sponsor a report to demonstrate confidence in its stock.</li>
                  <li>A competitor might commission research to highlight weaknesses in a rival’s business model.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Pros of Information Markets</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Income for Analysts</strong> – Provides independent analysts, traders, data scientists, and
                researchers with a new way to monetize their expertise, potentially creating a decentralized alternative
                to
                traditional financial analysts.</li>
              <li><strong>Analysis Over Speculation</strong> – Encourages deeper research and data-driven insights,
                shifting
                the focus away from purely speculative trading.</li>
              <li><strong>Market Efficiency</strong> – Better-informed traders contribute to more accurate market
                signals,
                enhancing overall price discovery.</li>
              <li><strong>Incentivizes Long-Term Predictions</strong> – With in-depth reports and better incentives for
                analysis, long-term bets become more viable, improving market signals and unlocking the full benefits of
                Price Prediction Markets.</li>
              <li><strong>Levels the Playing Field</strong> – Reduces the advantage of institutional players over retail
                traders by making high-quality research more accessible to the broader market.</li>
              <li><strong>Attracts Institutional Investors</strong> – Professional research firms (such as Bloomberg,
                Morningstar, or independent hedge funds) could sell premium research within prediction markets, drawing
                high-net-worth bettors and institutional participants into the ecosystem.</li>
              <li><strong>Legal and Regulatory Access</strong> – Information is stored in a centralized and accessible
                manner, making it available to regulators or law enforcement when investigating illegal activities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cons of Information Markets</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Manipulation</strong> – Sellers could manipulate the market by selling reports that falsely
                claim
                an asset's price will rise while secretly placing larger bets against it using another account or a
                different market. The increasing difficulty of verifying investor identities in the age of computers,
                the
                internet, and cryptocurrencies makes it challenging to prevent such deceptive practices.</li>
              <li><strong>Leaks</strong> – A buyer may pay for a report, but if it gets leaked or freely shared, its
                value
                decreases, as more people can place similar bets based on the insights. However, this issue already
                exists
                with financial reports produced by institutions, and it has not deterred them from continuing this line
                of
                business. Additionally, buyers have a personal incentive to keep purchased reports private, as leaking
                them
                would reduce their own competitive advantage in the market.</li>
              <li><strong>Legal & Regulatory Backlash</strong> – Governments might classify paid research as investment
                advice, subjecting it to strict financial regulations. If insider trading is involved, legal risks could
                escalate.</li>
            </ul>

        <article>
          <h2>Startups and SMEs Public Markets</h2>
          <div>
            <p>Currently, startups and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) are excluded from public markets due to the
              risks they pose to investors and the broader financial system. These risks include low trading volumes
              leading to price volatility, rapid shifts in financial and market conditions, and limited transparency in
              operational and financial reporting.</p>
            <p>However, these restrictions unintentionally create additional barriers for startups. By being unable to
              access public markets, they struggle to establish credibility with suppliers, distributors, banks, and
              other key stakeholders. This makes it unnecessarily difficult for promising businesses to secure funding,
              form partnerships, and scale effectively.</p>
            <p>If Price Prediction Markets and other financial innovations can mitigate these risks—for instance, by
              improving price discovery, enhancing transparency, and reducing volatility—then it may become viable to
              introduce alternative public markets tailored for startups and SMEs.</p>
            <p>Such a shift could be transformative, unlocking greater innovation, job creation, and economic dynamism
              by allowing smaller businesses to access liquidity and market-based credibility without the full regulatory
              burden of traditional stock exchanges.</p>

            <p>Other innovations can provide further assistance:</p>

            <h3>Narrow Trading Windows</h3>
            <div>
              <p>A major concern in opening public markets to smaller companies is low liquidity, which can lead to
                extreme
                price
                fluctuations and poor price discovery. One potential solution is concentrating liquidity into a narrow
                trading window. For example:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Startups and Small Companies can trade only on Wednesday afternoons.</li>
                <li>Medium-sized companies can trade only trade between Tuesday to Thursday, and only during afternoons.
                </li>
                <li>Once a company graduates to large-cap status, it would enter the full trading schedule like
                  traditional public companies.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>By limiting the frequency of trading, liquidity would be naturally concentrated, reducing price
                instability
                while still allowing smaller companies to access public investment capital.</p>

              <p>Price Prediction Markets on those assets do not need to be similarly time restricted, as they can
                provide important signals to inform spot trading, but if a scenario arises where
                these predictions are being traded as proxies to spot trading, copying the same time restriction could
                be a solution.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Education as a Prerequisite</h3>
            <div>
              <p>A common concern is that uninformed investors might take excessive risks or fall victim to scams when
                investing
                in smaller companies. Instead of relying on heavy-handed restrictions, a behavioral economics approach
                could be
                used to educate and empower investors.</p>
              <p>For example, before being allowed to invest in startups and SMEs, investors could be required to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Complete an online course on risk management, diversification, and consulting prediction markets
                  before
                  investing.</li>
                <li>Answer a short quiz monthly to maintain their eligibility for placing new investments.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This would serve as a gentle "nudge" toward informed investing—providing safeguards without the
                excessive
                micromanagement of many existing regulations, such as only allowing <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accredited_investor" target="_blank">Accredited Investors</a> to
                participate.</p>

              <p>Another way to encourage responsible investing is through an <strong>Investor Maturity Score</strong>,
                which evaluates an investor’s maturity based on past investment performance (even if based on small
                investments) and completion of educational material. Investors would start with a low score and
                gradually improve it over time, potentially unlocking access to riskier investment opportunities.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Investors with a medium score could invest in mid-sized companies but not in startups or small
                  companies.</li>
                <li>A higher score would grant access to early-stage investments and riskier financial products.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The Investor Maturity Score could benefit from two key psychological effects:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/basics/zeigarnik-effect" target="_blank">Zeigarnik
                    Effect</a> – People feel compelled to complete unfinished tasks. Investors may naturally want to
                  improve their score over time, reinforcing continuous learning and better decision-making.</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_comparison_theory" target="_blank">Social comparison
                    theory</a> – People evaluate themselves by comparing their abilities, performance, and status to
                  others. While the score would remain private, investors may naturally discuss it with peers,
                  encouraging friendly competition and motivation to improve.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The Investor Maturity Score should not be overly prescriptive or restrict investors from making their
                own decisions. To strike a balance, investors could be allowed to create their own investment "groups"
                or "buckets" based on their preferences.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>One investor might create risk-based buckets: Low, Medium, and High Risk.</li>
                <li>Another might organize investments by industry: AI, Semiconductors, Renewables, etc.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The Investor Maturity Score previous performance aspect will then be derived from their best performing
                group, proving that the investor knows how to invest wisely and manage risk, if they want to.</p>


            </div>

            <h3>Indexes and ETFs</h3>
            <p>One way to decrease investment risk in startups and SMEs is by creating index funds and Exchange Traded
              Funds (ETFs) that hold diversified baskets of stocks in these companies. This would allow investors to
              gain exposure to high-growth businesses while mitigating the risk associated with investing in a single
              company.</p>

            <p>Price Prediction Markets could further support this model by predicting the prices of these indexes and
              ETFs, further decreasing risk.</p>

            <p>This approach could synergize with the <strong>Investor Maturity Score</strong>. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Investors with a low maturity score might not be allowed to invest in individual startups but could
                still invest in a diversified index or ETF.</li>
              <li>As their maturity score improves, they could gain access to higher-risk individual investments.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Traditional ETFs follow passive management strategies, which keep fees relatively low. However,
              startup-focused ETFs may require more active oversight of invested companies, creating risks of
              mismanagement or conflicts of interest.</p>
            <p>One solution is to promote <strong>performance-based ETF fee structures</strong>, where fund managers are
              compensated only if they outperform a benchmark. Potential models include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Benchmark-linked fees</strong> – Management fees apply only if the fund outperforms a specific
                index.</li>
              <li><strong>Profit-sharing structures</strong> – Fund managers receive a percentage of profits exceeding a
                set benchmark.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This pay-for-performance model better aligns the interests of fund managers with those of less
              experienced investors, ensuring that investors pay fees only when they see real returns. This model has <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-for-performance_%28Investment%29" target="_blank">already shown
                some success</a> in improving fund performance and fairness.</p>

            <p>Venture Capitalists (VCs) are well-positioned to create ETFs focused on startups and SMEs, leveraging
              their expertise in evaluating, funding, and monitoring early-stage companies. Transforming VC funds into
              publicly available ETFs is the natural next step in their evolution.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <div>
              <p>By leveraging Price Prediction Markets, Narrow Trading Windows, Investor Education, and Indexes and
                ETFs, the risks associated with creating new public markets specializing in startups and SMEs could be
                effectively managed. If executed well, this shift could unlock tremendous economic benefits, fostering a
                more inclusive, innovative, and dynamic financial ecosystem.</p>

          <h2>Public Persona Bets</h2>
          <div>
            <p>Another application of Price Prediction Markets is their potential to increase transparency and
              accountability among individuals with potential conflicts of interest. Politicians, regulators, corporate
              executives, financial analysts, media pundits, and other influential figures could be required—or given
              the option—to publicly and automatically disclose their betting positions in these markets.</p>
            <p>This level of transparency would help expose biases, reveal hidden incentives, and build trust in both
              public figures and financial markets.</p>

            <p>Similar mechanisms already exist in traditional finance:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK_Act" target="_blank">U.S. STOCK Act</a> – Requires
                members of Congress and senior government officials to disclose stock trades within 45 days. However,
                many miss deadlines or file incomplete reports.</li>
              <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_4" target="_blank">SEC Form 4 Filings</a> – Corporate
                executives must disclose relevant stock derivative trades to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
                (SEC) by the end of the second business day following the trade.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To prevent immediate copycat behavior while still ensuring accountability, Price Prediction Market
              disclosures could be delayed for a predetermined period. This delay would balance transparency with
              fairness towards these individuals.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, an AI-powered tracking system could detect contradictions between public statements and
              private market positions. This system would flag cases where a public figure advocates for one outcome
              while secretly betting against it, highlighting potential conflicts of interest, misinformation, or
              unethical behavior in real-time.</p>

          <h2>Event and Price Hybrid Prediction Markets</h2>
          <div>
            <p>One potential disincentive for placing long-term bets in Price Prediction Markets is the unpredictability
              of major external shocks. Military conflicts, economic
              crises, pandemics, and other unforeseen events can drastically alter asset prices, turning a well-reasoned
              winning bet into a losing one. This uncertainty discourages long-term participation, potentially depriving
              society of essential long-term market signals.</p>


            <p>However, this challenge presents not only an opportunity for a solution, but this solution can also be a
              powerful tool to unlock new possibilities: <strong>Event and Price Hybrid Prediction Markets.</strong></p>

            <p>These markets function like standard Price Prediction Markets but include an additional safeguard: if
              certain pre-defined major events occurs, all bets are voided, and participants receive their money back.
              For example:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>A long-term prediction market on a stock’s price could be canceled if a major global pandemic (similar
                to COVID-19) severely disrupts economic activity.</li>
              <li>A market on the future value of a currency might be voided if a country experiences a sudden military
                or trade war.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Benefits of Event and Price Hybrid Prediction Markets:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Encourages Long-Term Bets</strong> – By mitigating the risk of unpredictable shocks, these
                markets make long-term participation more appealing.</li>
              <li><strong>Provides Crucial Market Signals</strong> – Investors, governments, businesses, and even
                individuals like students can use these predictions to make informed long-term decisions about where to
                allocate time and resources.</li>
              <li><strong>Maintains Market Fairness</strong> – Bettors are protected from extreme losses caused by
                unforeseeable crises rather than poor predictions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While this model offers many benefits, it also introduces certain challenges. The primary issue is the
              inherent subjectivity of event prediction—determining whether an event has actually occurred can be
              complex. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What specific metrics should be used to declare a pandemic as “major” or "global"?</li>
              <li>How do we define an trade war, distinguishing it from routine geopolitical tensions?</li>
            </ul>


            <p>One potential partial solution is for Price Prediction Markets to link their event conditions to existing
              <strong>Event Prediction Markets</strong>, leveraging their evolving definitions and resolution rules.
              These markets are continuously refined and adapted, improving accuracy over time.
            </p>

            <p>For example, a Price Prediction Market forecasting a stock’s future price could be linked to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>A separate Event Prediction Market estimating the likelihood of a major global pandemic.</li>
              <li>Another Event Prediction Market predicting the chances of a large-scale global war.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Benefits of This Approach:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Clearer Definitions</strong> – Event Prediction Markets would serve as independent references,
                improving objectivity in determining whether an event has occurred, which can be leveraged by any number
                of Price Prediction Markets.</li>
              <li><strong>Public Visibility</strong> – The public could observe how price predictions fluctuate in
                response to shifting probabilities of major events.</li>
              <li><strong>Enhanced Market Insights</strong> – Event Prediction Markets would effectively act as
                real-time factor analysis tools for Price Prediction Markets, providing greater transparency into the
                forces influencing asset prices.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By integrating these mechanisms, Price Prediction Markets could offer more reliable long-term forecasting
              while maintaining clear, publicly verifiable event conditions. This could significantly enhance
              decision-making across industries, governments, and individuals.</p>
            <p>However, this solution would admittedly only partially reduce the uncertainty around the resolution of
              predictions related to events.</p>



            <p>Another downside of Event and Price Hybrid Prediction Markets is that they could weaken the analytical
              depth of price predictions. Price Prediction Markets <b>purposefully</b> force analysts to consider
              multiple factors at once, providing a valuable signal to the public. For example: a prediction on the
              future price of an individual stock must account not only for the company’s performance but also for
              broader economic conditions, such as the likelihood of a major technological shift or a recession.
              This is crucial because it contains a valuable price sigsnal, for example if long-term predictions for
              most stocks across various sectors show pessimism,
              it shows a recession is likely and society can prepare accordingly.</p>

            <p>If hybrid markets introduce too many event-based exceptions, bettors could effectively gain a “get out of
              jail free” card by listing multiple external factors that nullify their predictions. This could dilute the
              depth of analysis in price forecasts, making them less useful as long-term signals.</p>

            <p>The challenge will be determining which events justify market cancellation while preserving the
              predictive integrity of Price Prediction Markets. Some events are foreseeable and should be
              factored into bets, while others are entirely unpredictable and should qualify for exclusion.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Clearly Predictable Events</strong> – Events that bettors could and should have accounted for,
                such as economic crises or recessions, should not be grounds for market cancellation. These are
                fundamental uncertainties that long-term predictions must consider.</li>
              <li><strong>Clearly Unpredictable Events</strong> – Extremely rare, unforeseen occurrences, such as first
                contact with extraterrestrial intelligent and hostile life or an undetected massive meteor impact, would
                render financial forecasting irrelevant and could justifiably nullify predictions.</li>
              <li><strong>Gray Area Events</strong> – Major global pandemics or wars fall somewhere in between. Early
                warning signs are often present, with specialists sounding the alarm, yet these signals are frequently
                ignored. While their exact timing is uncertain, their likelihood can be estimated based on historical
                patterns, risk assessments, and geopolitical trends. Including these events in predictions would allow
                the public to prepare, mitigate negative consequences and potentially even avert disasters.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Striking the right balance will be essential. Overuse of event-based cancellations could weaken market
              incentives, while underuse might discourage long-term participation. The goal should be to exclude only
              events so extreme and unforeseeable that they would render the prediction market ineffective while still
              ensuring that crucial long-term signals remain intact.</p>

            <p>One potential solution is to introduce a partial refund mechanism for gray area events. For example, a
              major global war would not completely void a Price Prediction Market, but it could trigger a rule where
              50% of the bet values are refunded to participants, while the market continues as planned. This approach
              ensures that long-term predictions remain valid while providing some protection against highly disruptive
              events.</p>

            <p>It is likely that finding this balance will be the subject of extensive studies, discussions, and
              experiments. My recommendation is to go beyond just the fairness aspect and also consider the
              <strong>desirability</strong> of including certain events in price signals. The key questions should be:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Do we want price signals to reflect these types of events?</li>
              <li>Would including these events make the predictions more useful to society?</li>
              <li>Are these events realistically predictable by bettors?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By addressing these considerations, Price Prediction Markets can be designed in a way that maximizes both
              fairness and their role as valuable forecasting tools.</p>

            <h3>Predicting Consequences of Decisions</h3>
            <div>

              <p>An exciting opportunity for Event and Price Hybrid Prediction Markets—one that is novel, at least in
                public markets—is their potential to forecast the consequences of key decisions. These markets could
                help society evaluate the impact of choices before they are made, offering a new layer of information,
                transparency and accountability.</p>

              <p>For example, during an important election, a Price Prediction Market could create two parallel markets
                forecasting the future price of a broad market index, such as the S&P 1500 Composite Index, at the end
                of the elected candidate’s mandate: One market predicting the index price if candidate A wins, and
                another if candidate B wins.</p>

              <p>To ensure a balanced perspective, similar markets could be created for economic indicators that
                disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, such as unemployment rates, inflation levels or mean
                real wages.</p>

              <p>By making these predictions available to the public, voters could consider a broader range of economic
                factors before casting their ballots. Instead of relying solely on campaign promises and political
                rhetoric, they could incorporate market-based forecasts into their decision-making process. This
                approach has the potential to make elections more data-driven, increasing public awareness of the likely
                economic consequences of different policy directions.</p>

              <p>Similarly, the introduction of major new legislation affecting a particular sector could trigger the
                creation of prediction markets to assess its potential impact. Such markets would provide policymakers
                with an important signal to consider before enacting laws, offering a market-based assessment of
                potential economic consequences. Additionally, companies operating in the affected sector could use
                these insights to prepare and adjust their strategies accordingly, reducing uncertainty and improving
                long-term planning.</p>

              <p>Companies could use hybrid prediction markets to assess the impact of major decisions, such as
                replacing a CEO or expanding into a new market. By creating parallel markets—one forecasting outcomes if
                the decision is made and another if it is not—executives and board members could gain valuable insights
                before committing to high-stakes changes. These market-based signals would help align corporate
                strategies with investor expectations, reduce uncertainty, and improve long-term planning.</p>


              <p><strong>Digression</strong>: For a time, I considered whether <strong>Financial Prediction
                  Markets</strong> might be a better concept than Price Prediction Markets, as they could cover not only
                asset prices but also other finance-related indicators, such as company revenue, EBITDA, and public
                metrics like unemployment, inflation, or GDP.</p>

              <p>However, many of these indicators are prone to manipulation. Companies frequently restate financial
                reports due to accounting errors or "creative accounting" that inflates certain figures.
                Government-released metrics suffer similar issues—unemployment rates often exclude those who have
                stopped job-seeking, and inflation calculations frequently omit rent costs.</p>

              <p>While prediction markets on these figures could be valuable, they rely on centralized reporting rather
                than decentralized market-driven price discovery, making them too susceptible to manipulation to serve
                as a reliable foundation.</p>

              <p>Fortunately, the need to assess the impact of policies on disadvantaged groups can still be addressed
                by extending the practice of using <strong>proxy stocks</strong>, now enhanced with future price
                predictions. For instance, during economic downturns, the future prices of discount retailers (such as
                dollar stores or bulk supermarkets) may rise, while high-end grocery chains and travel agencies may
                decline. These signals provide indirect yet market-driven insights into economic conditions, avoiding
                reliance on potentially manipulated official statistics.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Futarchy</h3>

            <div>

              <p>The economist Robin Hanson <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html"
                  target="_blank">proposed a governance model called Futarchy</a>: society would define broad objectives
                (such as increasing GDP or reducing unemployment), experts would propose policies to achieve these
                goals, and prediction markets would bet on which policies are most likely to succeed. Once a winning
                policy was clear, it would automatically become law.</p>


              <p>A fully implemented Futarchy, however, may be unwise for several reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>While prediction markets are difficult to manipulate, they are not mature enough to guarantee
                  absolute reliability, and they may never be. Entrusting them with direct legislative power would be
                  risky.</li>
                <li>Laws should not be enacted without human oversight and accountability. Prediction markets should
                  serve as a critical data point in policymaking but not as the sole determinant of laws.</li>
                <li>Many common policy objectives rely on statistics that can be easily manipulated by governments,
                  reducing the effectiveness of a system based solely on such metrics.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>However, a more balanced future governance model could still heavily incorporate prediction markets. As
                these markets mature and become widely integrated into decision-making, they could play a major role in
                shaping public discourse. Media coverage of prediction market trends, especially regarding major
                government decisions, could influence policymaking.</p>

              <p>In such a system, governments would still make all policy decisions, but prediction market approval
                could serve as a major endorsement, encouraging them to proceed. Conversely, strong disapproval from
                prediction markets could trigger intense public and media scrutiny. Governments could still enact
                policies against market sentiment, but doing so would require detailed explanations justifying why they
                believe the markets are wrong. In some cases, lawmakers might even face pressure to place public
                personal bets on their policy outcomes, reinforcing their confidence in the expected good outcomes.</p>

          <h2>Sponsorship</h2>
          <div>
            <p>Price Prediction Markets could be <strong>sponsored</strong>, meaning an entity contributes funds to the
              market without placing a bet, effectively seeding and increasing the future winners' pool. Even small
              sponsorships could act as catalysts, generating initial interest and triggering greater participation over
              time.</p>


            <p>Various entities could benefit from sponsoring these markets:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Governments</strong> – Sponsoring prediction markets could enhance transparency, strengthen
                market accountability, and improve decision-making. For example, the SEC could sponsor Price Prediction
                Markets for all S&P 500 companies, forecasting the Mean Price for each over a five-year horizon. This
                would incentivize participants to monitor and report potential fraud or mismanagement, reinforcing
                market integrity.</li>

              <li><strong>Policymakers</strong> – Governments could sponsor hybrid Event and Price Prediction Markets to
                evaluate the impact of proposed policies. These markets could forecast how different legislative
                initiatives might affect industries, employment, exchange rates, or economic growth, providing valuable
                guidance on the best path forward.</li>

              <li><strong>Companies</strong> – Businesses could sponsor markets in multiple ways:
                <ul>
                  <li>Sponsoring markets on their own stock to demonstrate confidence and signal transparency.</li>
                  <li>Sponsoring markets on sector-wide indexes or ETFs to encourage analysis of their industry’s
                    long-term viability.</li>
                  <li>Sponsoring markets on competitor stocks to stimulate analysis that could reveal vulnerabilities,
                    ultimately benefiting themselves.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>In some cases, the same market could have multiple sponsors with differing motives. For example, a
              company might sponsor a market for its own stock to reinforce investor trust, while a competitor sponsors
              the same market knowing that deeper scrutiny will expose weaknesses. Meanwhile, a government agency could
              also contribute, encouraging public oversight of a major industry player.</p>

            <p>Hybrid markets could also be sponsored to assess corporate decisions or analyze how government policies
              might impact foreign exchange rates. By facilitating sponsorship, Price Prediction Markets could increase
              their contribution to transparency, strategic forecasting, and market accountability.</p>

          <h2>Real Estate Price Prediction Markets</h2>
          <div>
            <p>A common problem worldwide is that homebuyers, particularly those purchasing or new houses, often end up
              with properties riddled with hidden defects. Construction companies frequently cut corners to save costs,
              leading to severe issues that only become apparent years later. Problems such as water infiltration,
              unstable foundations, and fire-prone cladding are just a few examples. When these defects arise, residents
              are left with unexpected costs, sometimes running into millions.</p>

            <p>Some governments enforce warranty periods, requiring construction companies to fix defects for a set
              number of years. However, this has limited success, as major repair costs can drive companies into
              bankruptcy. In some cases, former owners create new construction companies under different names, escaping
              liability.
              Either way, homeowners bear the burden.</p>

            <p>Price Prediction Markets could be part of the solution by allowing participants to bet on the future sale
              value of homes. These markets would help signal the likelihood of construction defects, as well as other
              important factors such as:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Structural Integrity and Quality</strong> – Homes with a higher likelihood of hidden defects,
                such as poor construction or substandard materials, would likely have lower predicted future prices.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Location Changes</strong> – Markets could indicate whether a neighborhood is improving or
                declining, signaling trends such as rising crime rates or upcoming infrastructure projects like new
                subway stations.</li>
              <li><strong>Environmental Risks</strong> – Homes in flood-prone areas or regions at risk of extreme
                weather events may show lower long-term sale values.</li>
              <li><strong>Child-Friendly Design</strong> – Features like gated staircases, soft flooring, and enclosed
                yards may increase demand from families with young children.</li>
              <li><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong> – As energy costs rise, homes with solar panels, battery storage,
                and high-efficiency insulation could attract higher predicted prices.</li>
              <li><strong>Safety</strong> – Modern fire escapes, sprinkler systems, and the shift away from gas stoves
                toward induction cooking may influence future home desirability.</li>
              <li><strong>Remote Work Adaptability</strong> – Dedicated office spaces, soundproofing, and high-speed
                internet connectivity could increase long-term value as remote work remains popular.</li>
              <li><strong>Smart Home Features</strong> – Automated security systems, smart thermostats, and
                app-controlled lighting may impact home prices.</li>
              <li><strong>Walkability & Transport Access</strong> – Pedestrian-friendly locations, proximity to bike
                lanes, and access to new public transit developments may drive higher demand.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These prediction markets would encourage construction companies to allow independent third-party
              inspections if they are confident in the quality of their work and later bet on future property values,
              making it easier for potential buyers to assess risks.</p>


            <p>While the benefits are clear, real estate-focused Price Prediction Markets face at least two major challenges:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Low Liquidity</strong> – Unlike financial markets, real estate transactions happen
                infrequently, sometimes with months or years between sales. This could be mitigated by setting
                prediction markets to operate over longer time intervals, such as the Mean Price of all apartment sales
                in a given complex over an entire year.</li>
              <li><strong>Lack of Fungibility</strong> – Unlike stocks or commodities, no two apartments are exactly the
                same. Differences in size, layout, sunlight exposure, noise levels, and views all impact valuation.
                Standardizing varied properties into a simplified and comparable metric would be the greatest challenge
                for real estate Price Prediction Markets.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While a complete solution has yet to be developed, these initial ideas could serve as a starting point
              for discussion and experimentation. If their challenges is solved, Real Estate Price
              Prediction Markets could provide homebuyers with a powerful tool for making informed decisions and holding
              developers accountable.</p>

      <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Self Defeating Long term markets</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Ironically, long-term bets in Price Prediction Markets may fail precisely because they are too
            accurate. By providing strong market signals, these predictions could influence the very factors
            they aim to forecast, leading to self-defeating outcomes.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Negative Predictions Trigger Intervention</strong> – If the market heavily bets against a
              company’s stock—predicting it will lose value in a few years—the board of directors may intervene by
              firing the CEO and implementing corrective measures. As a result, the company may recover, and the
              predicted stock decline never materializes.</li>

            <li><strong>Positive Predictions Induce Complacency</strong> – Conversely, if the market predicts a strong
              rise in stock value, company leadership may interpret this as validation of their current strategy and
              avoid making additional improvements or taking risks, ultimately causing the stock price to stagnate
              instead of rising as expected.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In both cases, the prediction itself alters reality, making longer term bets less reliable as prediction or
            investment tools. This phenomenon is unique to long-term markets, as shorter term market signals are
            unlikely to trigger meaningful real-world changes quickly enough to significantly impact prices.</p>



          <p>If no adjustments are made to address the challenges of longer time horizons, certain timeframes
            may naturally prove more effective than others:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Short-term bets</b> have limited opportunities for meaningful price shifts, reducing the
              chance for high-profit, unconventional bets.</li>
            <li><b>Long-term bets</b> are highly susceptible to self defeating influence—as
              companies and economies may adjust their strategies in response to predictions, distorting
              outcomes.</li>
            <li><b>Medium-term bets</b> may hit the "sweet spot", capturing meaningful changes while remaining
              less prone to self-disruption.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Based on these factors, an educated guess suggests that the optimal timeframe for Price Prediction
            Markets will fall in the medium term—approximately 1 to 3 years. However, this is only an average
            across industries, and the ideal prediction window will vary by sector.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In fast-moving industries like software and technology, innovation cycles are rapid, and
              competitive
              landscapes shift quickly. As a result, medium-term bets might mean 6-18 months.</li>
            <li>In industries that rely on heavy, long-term investments in physical infrastructure, such as
              construction,
              energy, and large-scale manufacturing, changes occur more gradually. In these cases, medium-term
              bets
              might
              mean
              3-5 year.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Instead of a fixed universal timeframe, Price Prediction Markets will likely self-adjust based on
            industry-specific rates of change, creating flexible forecasting tools tailored to different
            sectors.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, the <strong>most popular timeframes</strong> in Price Prediction Markets could serve as a
            market
            signal in themselves:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>During stable economic periods, the ideal betting window may shift further into the future, as
              longer term
              trends become more predictable.</li>
            <li>In times of uncertainty or crisis, the market’s "sweet spot" may shorten, as economic volatility
              makes
              longer term predictions less reliable.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This natural adaptability could provide valuable insights, helping gauge economic confidence and
            risk tolerance across regions, industries, and time horizons.</p>

          <p>To maintain the effectiveness of Price Prediction Markets for long-term forecasting, several potential
            solutions could be implemented:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Allowing Bet Withdrawals with Increasing Penalties</strong> – Participants could withdraw
              long-term bets before settlement, but with a penalty that grows as the settlement date approaches. For
              example, withdrawing a bet due in five years might result in forfeiting 5% of the bet’s value.</li>
            <li><strong>Increasing Profitability for Long-Term Bets</strong> – Adjusting the reward score to provide
              greater incentives for early bets could encourage more long-term participation. This could include higher
              multipliers for bets placed well in advance, or decreasing the penalty for wider ranges in early bets,
              ensuring they remain attractive despite increased uncertainty.</li>
            <li><strong>Liquidity-Based Rewards</strong> – Markets with low liquidity, particularly long-term ones,
              could offer higher rewards as an incentive. This would encourage participants to enter less-active
              markets, improving overall market efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Bet Transfers</strong> – A secondary market could be created where users can sell or transfer
              their existing bets. This would provide early bettors with an option for liquidity while unlocking new
              market dynamics and trading strategies.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>By incorporating these mechanisms, Price Prediction Markets can remain viable tools for long-term
            forecasting while balancing flexibility and commitment.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Heterogeneity</h2>
        <div>
          <p>A potential challenge for Price Prediction Markets is the risk of excessive variation in their design and
            operation. With diverse applications and features, participants may struggle to understand how each market
            functions, leading to hesitation and reduced liquidity. This stands in contrast to stock markets, where most
            global exchanges have coalesced around standardized rules, allowing investors to move capital with
            confidence.</p>

          <p>Potential solutions: </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Global Standards</strong> – Establishing optional international standards with default rules
              could provide consistency. Markets adhering to these standards could be clearly labeled, helping users
              quickly identify reliable and familiar structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Differentiation</strong> – Experimental markets with unique features should be clearly
              distinguished, ensuring users know they are engaging with non-standard mechanisms.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparent Rule Changes</strong> – Any changes to rules in new market should be communicated
              well in advance, giving participants ample time to review, provide feedback, and adjust their strategies
              accordingly.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By implementing clear communication, optional standardization, and structured differentiation, Price
            Prediction Markets can offer both stability and innovation while maintaining user confidence.</p>
