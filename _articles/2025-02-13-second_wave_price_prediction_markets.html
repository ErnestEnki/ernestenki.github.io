    <h1>Add on: Information Markets</h1>

    Event and PRice hybrid market, example: what will be the Nasdaq index be valued after one year after president A or
    B wins election ?
    RElational price hybrid market, example: what will be percentage growht of NVidia - Nasdaq ? this can be quite
    useful to account for inflation, or the value of a low risk investment (comparitevely)

    Potential Add On

    A market for information such as company and market resarch can be created as part of a Price Prediction Market,

    - High-skill bettors or independent analysts **research stocks, commodities, or crypto assets**.
    - They **sell their insights or models** to other traders who might not have the time or skill to analyze data.

    **More accurate price predictions**

    (better informed traders = better market efficiency).

    ✔

    **Reduces information asymmetry**

    (lowers the advantage of institutional players over retail traders).

    ✔

    **Incentivizes real analysis instead of pure speculation**

    ### **Creates a Secondary Income Stream for Researchers & Analysts**

    🔹 **How It Works:**

    - Researchers, journalists, or independent traders **earn money** not only from **winning bets** but also from
    **selling reports** to other bettors.
    - This allows **talented individuals** to monetize **valuable insights** without needing a hedge fund job.

    ✅ **Why It’s Useful:**

    ✔ **Encourages high-quality analysis from independent voices.**

    ✔ **Gives non-traders a way to participate in prediction markets.**

    ✔ **Creates a decentralized alternative to traditional financial analysts.**

    - If betting markets **predict corporate failure or fraud**, it puts **pressure on CEOs & board members** to **act
    transparently**.
    - Activist investors **use prediction market data** to challenge bad management

    ntroduces Risk-Sharing & Performance-Based Payments
    🔹 How It Works:

    Instead of charging upfront fees, researchers can offer reports for free but take a small percentage of winnings if
    the bettor profits.
    This aligns incentives between analysts & bettors—researchers only make money if their predictions are correct.
    ✅ Why It’s Useful:
    ✔ Lower barriers for bettors who don’t want to pay upfront.
    ✔ **Encourages analysts to focus on accurate, actionable insights.
    ✔ Creates a competitive knowledge marketplace where only proven researchers thrive.

    **A new industry of “prediction market audits” will emerge** to detect fake bets, misleading reports, and bad
    actors, in the worst case scenairo.

    Good quality analysis can be separated from bad ones with a range of means, for example, from the traditional star
    rating from buyers, to the market publicly displaying the performance of their past bets, to their willingness to
    receive shared revenue from bets instead of upfront paint.

    Risks: fake information and scams, sellers could sell reports saying that a certain asset price will go up, and even
    place a small public bet saying the same; but use another account on the same prediction markert, or another market,
    to bet large amounts of money on the opposite, profiting by misleading people. In the age of computers, internet and
    cryptocurrencies, ensuring the identity of investors is increasingly difficult.

    Insider Trading

    What if someone with insider information sells reports containing non-public material facts, this would be a breach
    of the law. these markets would certainly provide more incentives for this kind of illegal activitiy.

    However, these markets could also serve as a honeypot for regulators, providing a centralized trap where
    investigators know to look for such kind of thing.

    If in the long term, this will provide a net increase or decrease of insider trading, remains to be seen.

    Freely shared information

    It could happen that someone pays for a report or model, but it ends up being leaked freely to the public,
    decreasing the value of the information and bets associated with it. However, this is an existing problem with
    reports produced by financial institutions, and to this day it has not stopped them from this line of business.
    Furthermore, buyers are less likely to leak purchased reports, as it would decrease the value of their own bets, by
    allowing the public to place similar bets.



    Allows Institutional-Grade Research to Enter Prediction Markets
    🔹 How It Works:

    Professional research firms (like Bloomberg, Morningstar, or independent hedge funds) could sell premium research
    inside prediction markets.
    This attracts high-net-worth bettors and institutions into the ecosystem.

    **Makes institutional-grade analysis available to retail traders.**

    ✔

    **Improves prediction accuracy & market efficiency**

      <h2>Startups and SMEs Public Markets</h2>
      <p>Currently, startups and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) are not allowed to be publicly traded due to the risks
        involved for investors and the broader market. These risks include low trading volumes, rapid changes in financial
        conditions, and limited transparency. Such barriers also make it harder for startups to secure partnerships with
        suppliers, distributors, banks, and other key stakeholders, further complicating their survival.</p>
      <p>However, if Prediction Markets can help meaningfully reduce these risks, the benefits of allowing startups and
        SMEs to participate in public markets could be transformative—driving more innovation, job creation, and economic
        dynamism.</p>
  
  
      <h3>Solving Low Liquidity Through Tight Trading Windows</h3>
      <p>A major concern in opening public markets to smaller companies is low liquidity, which can lead to extreme price
        fluctuations and poor price discovery. One potential solution is concentrating liquidity in scheduled trading
        windows.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Startups could trade only on Wednesday afternoons.</li>
        <li>Small companies could trade on Tuesdays through Thursdays.</li>
        <li>Medium-sized companies could trade every weekday afternoon.</li>
        <li>Once a company graduates to large-cap status, it would enter the full trading schedule like traditional public
          companies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By limiting the frequency of trading, liquidity would be naturally concentrated, reducing price instability while
        still allowing smaller companies to access public investment capital.</p>
  
      <h3>Investor Education as a Prerequisite for Participation</h3>
      <p>A common concern is that uninformed investors might take excessive risks or fall victim to scams when investing
        in smaller companies. Instead of relying on heavy-handed restrictions, a behavioral economics approach could be
        used to educate and empower investors.</p>
      <p>For example, before being allowed to invest in startups and SMEs, investors could be required to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete an online course on risk management, diversification, and consulting prediction markets before
          investing.</li>
        <li>Answer a short quiz monthly to maintain their eligibility for placing new investments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This would serve as a gentle "nudge" toward informed investing—providing safeguards without the excessive
        micromanagement of many existing regulations, such as only allowing <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accredited_investor" target="_blank">Accredited Investors</a> to
        participate.</p>
  
      <h3>Risk Reduction Through Index Funds & ETFs</h3>
      <p>Another way to mitigate risk is by creating index funds and ETFs that hold baskets of startup and SME stocks.
        Investors would then be able to gain exposure to early-stage companies while still diversifying their risk across
        multiple businesses.</p>
      <p>This approach would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a structured way for investors to enter the startup space without betting everything on individual
          companies.</li>
        <li>Reduce volatility by spreading risk across many smaller firms.</li>
        <li>Encourage long-term investment in high-growth sectors, benefiting both companies and investors.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By leveraging prediction markets, scheduled trading, investor education, and diversified funds, the risks of
        allowing startups and SMEs into public markets could be managed effectively. If executed well, this shift could
        unlock tremendous economic benefits, creating a more inclusive, innovative, and dynamic financial ecosystem.</p>

      possibility of sponsorship, like sponsor markets on certain events (imagine an SEC-sanctioned market on each S&P 500 firm’s 5-year fraud risk). If companies embrace them, they could integrate internal markets into risk management and decision processes (like using markets to vet major project forecasts or merger outcomes)

      Futarchy – A Governance by Prediction Markets (a theoretical aside): Economist Robin Hanson has proposed “futarchy,” a form of governance where decisions are made by prediction markets. The idea is that instead of voting for policies directly, citizens/policymakers would vote on values but bet on outcomes. For example, a government could create a market for “If policy A is adopted, will GDP reach $X by 2025?” versus “If policy B is adopted, will GDP reach $X by 2025?”. Whichever has better odds (higher expected outcome) would dictate the policy choice. In corporate terms, one could imagine a board of directors using prediction markets on key performance metrics to guide strategy (or even to decide whether to fire a CEO based on predicted outcomes). While futarchy is largely theoretical and beyond our scope, it’s relevant as an extreme application of prediction markets as a decision/oversight tool. It highlights the faith some proponents have in market-based information aggregation over traditional human oversight.</p>
