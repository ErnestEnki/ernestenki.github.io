    <h1>Add on: Information Markets</h1>

    Event and PRice hybrid market, example: what will be the Nasdaq index be valued after one year after president A or
    B wins election ?
    RElational price hybrid market, example: what will be percentage growht of NVidia - Nasdaq ? this can be quite
    useful to account for inflation, or the value of a low risk investment (comparitevely)

    Potential Add On

    A market for information such as company and market resarch can be created as part of a Price Prediction Market,

    - High-skill bettors or independent analysts **research stocks, commodities, or crypto assets**.
    - They **sell their insights or models** to other traders who might not have the time or skill to analyze data.

    **More accurate price predictions**

    (better informed traders = better market efficiency).

    ‚úî

    **Reduces information asymmetry**

    (lowers the advantage of institutional players over retail traders).

    ‚úî

    **Incentivizes real analysis instead of pure speculation**

    ### **Creates a Secondary Income Stream for Researchers & Analysts**

    üîπ **How It Works:**

    - Researchers, journalists, or independent traders **earn money** not only from **winning bets** but also from
    **selling reports** to other bettors.
    - This allows **talented individuals** to monetize **valuable insights** without needing a hedge fund job.

    ‚úÖ **Why It‚Äôs Useful:**

    ‚úî **Encourages high-quality analysis from independent voices.**

    ‚úî **Gives non-traders a way to participate in prediction markets.**

    ‚úî **Creates a decentralized alternative to traditional financial analysts.**

    - If betting markets **predict corporate failure or fraud**, it puts **pressure on CEOs & board members** to **act
    transparently**.
    - Activist investors **use prediction market data** to challenge bad management

    ntroduces Risk-Sharing & Performance-Based Payments
    üîπ How It Works:

    Instead of charging upfront fees, researchers can offer reports for free but take a small percentage of winnings if
    the bettor profits.
    This aligns incentives between analysts & bettors‚Äîresearchers only make money if their predictions are correct.
    ‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Useful:
    ‚úî Lower barriers for bettors who don‚Äôt want to pay upfront.
    ‚úî **Encourages analysts to focus on accurate, actionable insights.
    ‚úî Creates a competitive knowledge marketplace where only proven researchers thrive.

    **A new industry of ‚Äúprediction market audits‚Äù will emerge** to detect fake bets, misleading reports, and bad
    actors, in the worst case scenairo.

    Good quality analysis can be separated from bad ones with a range of means, for example, from the traditional star
    rating from buyers, to the market publicly displaying the performance of their past bets, to their willingness to
    receive shared revenue from bets instead of upfront paint.

    Risks: fake information and scams, sellers could sell reports saying that a certain asset price will go up, and even
    place a small public bet saying the same; but use another account on the same prediction markert, or another market,
    to bet large amounts of money on the opposite, profiting by misleading people. In the age of computers, internet and
    cryptocurrencies, ensuring the identity of investors is increasingly difficult.

    Insider Trading

    What if someone with insider information sells reports containing non-public material facts, this would be a breach
    of the law. these markets would certainly provide more incentives for this kind of illegal activitiy.

    However, these markets could also serve as a honeypot for regulators, providing a centralized trap where
    investigators know to look for such kind of thing.

    If in the long term, this will provide a net increase or decrease of insider trading, remains to be seen.

    Freely shared information

    It could happen that someone pays for a report or model, but it ends up being leaked freely to the public,
    decreasing the value of the information and bets associated with it. However, this is an existing problem with
    reports produced by financial institutions, and to this day it has not stopped them from this line of business.
    Furthermore, buyers are less likely to leak purchased reports, as it would decrease the value of their own bets, by
    allowing the public to place similar bets.



    Allows Institutional-Grade Research to Enter Prediction Markets
    üîπ How It Works:

    Professional research firms (like Bloomberg, Morningstar, or independent hedge funds) could sell premium research
    inside prediction markets.
    This attracts high-net-worth bettors and institutions into the ecosystem.

    **Makes institutional-grade analysis available to retail traders.**

    ‚úî

    **Improves prediction accuracy & market efficiency**

    <h3>Illiquid and Emerging Assets</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Many small-cap stocks, exotic commodities, or illiquid assets suffer from poor price discovery due to
        low
        trading
        volume. Prediction markets could offer an alternative way to determine the ‚Äúfair‚Äù value of an asset,
        smoothing
        out
        erratic price swings and reducing artificial volatility.</p>              
    </div>
    
    <article>
      <h3>Self Defeating Long term bets and Too Much Uncertainty</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Ironically, long-term bets in Price Prediction Markets may fail precisely because they are too
          accurate. By providing strong market signals, these predictions could influence the very factors
          they aim to forecast, leading to self-defeating outcomes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the market heavily bets against a company‚Äôs stock‚Äîpredicting it will lose value in a year‚Äîthe
            board
            of
            directors may intervene by firing the CEO and implementing corrective measures. As a result, the
            company
            may
            recover, and the predicted stock decline never materializes.</li>
          <li>Conversely, if the market predicts a strong rise in stock value, company leadership may
            interpret
            this
            as
            validation of their current strategy and avoid making additional improvements or taking risks,
            ultimately
            causing the stock price to stagnate instead of rising as expected.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In both cases, the prediction itself alters reality, making long-term bets less reliable as
          prediction / investment tools.</p>

        <p>Additionally, long-term market participation may suffer due to high uncertainty. Events such as
          wars, pandemics, and economic crises can drastically alter price trajectories, making it difficult
          for traders to commit capital to long-term bets.</p>

        <h4>If we do nothing</h4>

        <p>If no adjustments are made to address the challenges of different time horizons, certain timeframes
          may naturally prove more effective for investments than others:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Short-term bets</b> have limited opportunities for meaningful price shifts, reducing the
            chance for high-profit, unconventional bets.</li>
          <li><b>Long-term bets</b> are highly susceptible to unpredictable events and market influence‚Äîas
            companies and economies may adjust their strategies in response to predictions, distorting
            outcomes.</li>
          <li><b>Medium-term bets</b>may hit the "sweet spot", capturing meaningful changes while remaining
            less prone to self-disruption and unexpected market shocks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Based on these factors, an educated guess suggests that the optimal timeframe for Price Prediction
          Markets will fall in the medium term‚Äîapproximately 1 to 3 years. However, this is only an average
          across industries, and the ideal prediction window will vary by sector.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In fast-moving industries like software and technology, innovation cycles are rapid, and
            competitive
            landscapes shift quickly. As a result, medium-term bets might mean 6-18 months.</li>
          <li>In industries that rely on heavy, long-term investments in physical infrastructure, such as
            construction,
            energy, and large-scale manufacturing, changes occur more gradually. In these cases, medium-term
            bets
            might
            mean
            3-5 year.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Instead of a fixed universal timeframe, Price Prediction Markets will likely self-adjust based on
          industry-specific rates of change, creating flexible forecasting tools tailored to different
          sectors.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the <b>most popular timeframes in Price Prediction Markets could serve as a market
            signal</b>
          in
          themselves:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>During stable economic periods, the ideal betting window may shift further into the future, as
            long-term
            trends become more predictable.</li>
          <li>In times of uncertainty or crisis, the market‚Äôs "sweet spot" may shorten, as economic volatility
            makes
            long-term predictions less reliable.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This natural adaptability could provide valuable insights, helping gauge economic confidence and
          risk tolerance across regions, industries, and time horizons.</p>


        <h4>If we try to solve the problem</h4>

        <p>If we wanted to ensure Price Prediction Markets are functional for long term markets, there are a
          number of potential solutions:
          allowing the withdrawing of bets, potentially with a penalty
          increase the timeframe, earlier we suggested betting on the mean price over an entire month, but if
          we extended to the price over longer periods, like a quarter, semester or entire year; it would make
          the price less unstable

        <p>Solution, longer time periods, like 1 year, or the last 1y ?</p>

        <p>cancel bets in case of major unpredictable eventes, like insurance</p>

      <h2>Startups and SMEs Public Markets</h2>
      <p>Currently, startups and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) are not allowed to be publicly traded due to the risks
        involved for investors and the broader market. These risks include low trading volumes, rapid changes in financial
        conditions, and limited transparency. Such barriers also make it harder for startups to secure partnerships with
        suppliers, distributors, banks, and other key stakeholders, further complicating their survival.</p>
      <p>However, if Prediction Markets can help meaningfully reduce these risks, the benefits of allowing startups and
        SMEs to participate in public markets could be transformative‚Äîdriving more innovation, job creation, and economic
        dynamism.</p>
  
  
      <h3>Solving Low Liquidity Through Tight Trading Windows</h3>
      <p>A major concern in opening public markets to smaller companies is low liquidity, which can lead to extreme price
        fluctuations and poor price discovery. One potential solution is concentrating liquidity in scheduled trading
        windows.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Startups could trade only on Wednesday afternoons.</li>
        <li>Small companies could trade on Tuesdays through Thursdays.</li>
        <li>Medium-sized companies could trade every weekday afternoon.</li>
        <li>Once a company graduates to large-cap status, it would enter the full trading schedule like traditional public
          companies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By limiting the frequency of trading, liquidity would be naturally concentrated, reducing price instability while
        still allowing smaller companies to access public investment capital.</p>
  
      <h3>Investor Education as a Prerequisite for Participation</h3>
      <p>A common concern is that uninformed investors might take excessive risks or fall victim to scams when investing
        in smaller companies. Instead of relying on heavy-handed restrictions, a behavioral economics approach could be
        used to educate and empower investors.</p>
      <p>For example, before being allowed to invest in startups and SMEs, investors could be required to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete an online course on risk management, diversification, and consulting prediction markets before
          investing.</li>
        <li>Answer a short quiz monthly to maintain their eligibility for placing new investments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This would serve as a gentle "nudge" toward informed investing‚Äîproviding safeguards without the excessive
        micromanagement of many existing regulations, such as only allowing <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accredited_investor" target="_blank">Accredited Investors</a> to
        participate.</p>
  
      <h3>Risk Reduction Through Index Funds & ETFs</h3>
      <p>Another way to mitigate risk is by creating index funds and ETFs that hold baskets of startup and SME stocks.
        Investors would then be able to gain exposure to early-stage companies while still diversifying their risk across
        multiple businesses.</p>
      <p>This approach would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a structured way for investors to enter the startup space without betting everything on individual
          companies.</li>
        <li>Reduce volatility by spreading risk across many smaller firms.</li>
        <li>Encourage long-term investment in high-growth sectors, benefiting both companies and investors.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>By leveraging prediction markets, scheduled trading, investor education, and diversified funds, the risks of
        allowing startups and SMEs into public markets could be managed effectively. If executed well, this shift could
        unlock tremendous economic benefits, creating a more inclusive, innovative, and dynamic financial ecosystem.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Individuals with potential conflicts of interest, such as politicians, regulators, corporate executives, pundits of all kinds
        and
        financial commentators, could be required‚Äîor given the option‚Äîto have their bets in Price Prediction
        Markets
        made
        public. This could be done with a delay to prevent immediate copycat behavior while still ensuring
        transparency.
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, an AI-powered tracking system could flag contradictions between public statements and
        private
        betting positions, helping to detect potential conflicts of interest or unethical behavior in real-time.

      Futarchy ‚Äì A Governance by Prediction Markets (a theoretical aside): Economist Robin Hanson has proposed ‚Äúfutarchy,‚Äù a form of governance where decisions are made by prediction markets. The idea is that instead of voting for policies directly, citizens/policymakers would vote on values but bet on outcomes. For example, a government could create a market for ‚ÄúIf policy A is adopted, will GDP reach $X by 2025?‚Äù versus ‚ÄúIf policy B is adopted, will GDP reach $X by 2025?‚Äù. Whichever has better odds (higher expected outcome) would dictate the policy choice. In corporate terms, one could imagine a board of directors using prediction markets on key performance metrics to guide strategy (or even to decide whether to fire a CEO based on predicted outcomes). While futarchy is largely theoretical and beyond our scope, it‚Äôs relevant as an extreme application of prediction markets as a decision/oversight tool. It highlights the faith some proponents have in market-based information aggregation over traditional human oversight.</p>
