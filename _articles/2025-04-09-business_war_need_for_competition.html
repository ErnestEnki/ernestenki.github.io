      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <div>

        <p>Open any news outlet and you will likely find stories of <strong>conflict</strong>—from full-scale wars to economic standoffs between nations. At the same time, we are launching satellites into orbit, creating Artificial Intelligences once thought to be science fiction, and making breakthroughs that defy
          imagination.</p>

        <p>On one hand, we are progressing faster than ever. On the other, we seem to be <strong>regressing into tribalism and violence</strong>, repeating the same primitive behaviors we once believed humanity had outgrown.</p>

        <p>This <strong>stark contrast</strong> leaves many of us puzzled. How can such opposing realities exist side by side? What are the root causes that sustain this paradox?</p>

        <p>This section revisits and builds upon themes first explored in my earlier book, <a href="/books/patent_dystopia/summary.html" target="_blank">Patent Dystopia</a>. That work examined how <strong>patents strangle modern innovation</strong>, but also touched on deeper historical and systemic parallels between
          <strong>business and war</strong>—particularly how both rely on <strong>competition</strong> as a necessary force for job creation and innovation.
        </p>

        <p>Here, we expand that argument and explore how the failure to maintain <strong>open and fair competition</strong> leads not only to stagnation but to war itself.</p>

      <h1>Similarities Between Business and War</h1>

      <div>
        <p>Business and war share a core purpose: they both compete for resources.</p>

        <p>Businesses compete through <strong>creation</strong>—by selling products and services in exchange for money, which they can then use to acquire the resources they want.</p>

        <p>War competes through <strong>destruction</strong>—by threatening or causing damage to force others to surrender the resources they control.</p>

        <p>Because the competitive dynamics of business and war are structurally similar, they also share many <strong>parallels in how they create jobs</strong>. This holds not just at a high level, but in the mechanisms of operation and resource mobilization:</p>


        <ul>
          <li><strong>In war:</strong> When a new enemy appears, governments always find funds for bombs and warplanes—even if they previously claimed no budget for essentials like schools or hospitals. This surge of activity creates many jobs.
            <br />
            <strong>In business:</strong> In a true free market (without patents), when a serious competitor emerges, companies suddenly find funds for R&D, offer raises to retain key staff, and invest heavily in marketing—even if they had just claimed they could not afford cost-of-living increases. This surge of
            activity creates many jobs.
          </li>

          <li><strong>In war:</strong> Governments employ intelligence officers to gather information, craft strategies, spread propaganda, and attempt to turn enemy operatives. This generates jobs.
            <br />
            <strong>In business:</strong> Companies hire marketing teams, strategy analysts, and recruiters to gather competitive intelligence and win market share. This generates jobs.
          </li>

          <li><strong>In war:</strong> Soldiers serve as the tip of the spear, pushing into enemy territory to achieve victory. This generates jobs.
            <br />
            <strong>In business:</strong> Sales teams, PR professionals, and brand evangelists act as the spearhead in competitive markets, pushing to expand market share. This generates jobs.
          </li>

          <li><strong>In war:</strong> Engineers and scientists develop new technologies to outmatch the enemy. This generates jobs.
            <br />
            <strong>In business:</strong> Engineers and scientists innovate to outpace competitors. This generates jobs.
          </li>

          <li><strong>In war:</strong> Enemy attacks destroy assets like roads, bridges, and aircraft—creating a need for cleanup and rebuilding. This generates jobs.
            <br />
            <strong>In business:</strong> Competitors' innovations render products, tools, or strategies obsolete—creating a need for replacement and reinvention. This generates jobs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>These parallels are no coincidence. Both business and war create jobs by embracing <strong>competition without patent barriers</strong>. They ignore monopolies, and in doing so, unleash innovation and economic dynamism. We will soon explore historical examples that show this dynamic in action.</p>

      <h1>The Need for Competition, in One Form or Another</h1>

      <p>I propose these theories forward:</p>

      <p><strong>1) A lack of business competition encourages military conflict.</strong> The chain reaction looks like this: a weak job market leads to fewer and lower-paying jobs, which creates economic stress and social frustration. A stressed population becomes more vulnerable to demagogues, extreme ideologies, and
        emotional overreactions. The outcome is often conflict—ranging from civil unrest to full-scale war.</p>

      <p>This connection is not new. The French economist <a href="https://fee.org/resources/if-goods-dont-cross-borders/" target="_blank">Frédéric Bastiat once captured the idea simply</a>: <em>“When goods do not cross borders, soldiers will.”</em></p>

      <p><strong>2) A broken economy and job market is largely the result of a the patent system</strong>. Patents allow dominant companies to form oligopolies by preemptively claiming rights to useful technologies. They build massive portfolios, not to innovate, but to block competition. This strategy systematically
        destroys small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which make up <a href="https://doi.org/10.1787/34907e9c-en" target="_blank">99% of businesses and 60% of employment in OECD countries</a>.</p>

      <p>This is the core thesis of my earlier book, <a href="/books/patent_dystopia/summary.html" target="_blank">Patent Dystopia</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>3) Modern history shows a recurring pattern—a cycle of patents and war that has gone largely unnoticed:</strong></p>

      <h2>The Patent-War Cycle Explained</h2>
      <div>
        <img src="/books/patent_dystopia/images/patent_war_cycle.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Diagram of the Patent-War Cycle" />
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Patents weaken the economy:</strong> A strong, strictly enforced patent system undermines innovation, weakens the job market and economy, and blocks individuals and companies from gaining Education.</li>

          <li><strong>Countries diverge in response:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Some countries—usually a minority—begin ignoring patents to revive their economies.</li>
              <li>Others, often the leading powers, stick with the status quo. Their populations suffer increasing economic stress and begin leaning toward extremism, authoritarianism, and social aggression—across all levels of society, from individual behavior to governmental decisions.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li><strong>Confrontation emerges:</strong> The economically revived, patent-ignoring country uses its new strength to confront rivals.

            <ul>
              <li>Sometimes these challengers are righteous (like the early United States), other times tyrannical (like Nazi Germany). The common factor is not ideology—but the use of open innovation to gain power.</li>
            </ul>

          </li>

          <li><strong>War breaks out:</strong> Conflict erupts between the two sides.</li>

          <li><strong>Patents are abandoned in wartime:</strong> All parties drop patent enforcement to accelerate the development of weapons, machines, and production capacity.</li>

          <li><strong>Innovation and job creation surge:</strong> Rapid job creation and Education take place across industries, as economies shift into high gear. Unfortunately this gives credibility to demagogues.</li>

          <li><strong>Peace:</strong> One side wins—often the one with more economic freedom, which granted them better resource management. Peace is restored.</li>

          <li><strong>Return to “normal”:</strong> Society pushes to reinstate order, including the reestablishment of strong and strict patent systems.</li>

          <li><strong>The cycle begins again.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>This cycle does not apply to every conflict or period in exact terms, but it is a recognizable pattern across major global developments. As Mark Twain put it: <em>“History does not repeat itself, but it often rhymes.”</em></p>

      </div>

      <p>Here is another way to see it: a bad job market will eventually lead to social disruption. That disruption is resolved—<strong>either voluntarily or violently</strong>—by ignoring patents until the job market heals.</p>

      <p>In the end, we have only two options:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Abolish patents during peacetime</strong>, allowing businesses to compete freely, fueling innovation and job creation through healthy market dynamics.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignore patents during wartime</strong>, as militaries scramble to innovate and produce freely under existential pressure—again triggering job creation and economic growth, but at a much higher cost.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>Ignoring patents is not optional. The only real choice is when—and at what cost—we choose to do it.</blockquote>

      <p>Let us now examine how this cycle has played out in the past.</p>

      <h1>Background: The Origins of the Patent System</h1>

      <div>
        <p>The modern concept of systematic patent law can be traced back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent" target="_blank">1474 in Venice</a>. Patents were not awarded to original inventors, but to <strong>introducers of technologies</strong>—those who brought new crafts and techniques into a
          city-state.</p>

        <p>This was a practical policy. To convince skilled artisans to relocate, city governments needed to offer strong incentives. Migration was risky—plagued by wars, poor roads, high transport costs, and the challenges of setting up business in a new place with different language and customs. Patents gave these
          artisans a temporary monopoly as compensation for those risks.</p>

        <p>As Venetian artisans emigrated, they sought similar protections in their new homes. This led to the diffusion of patent systems across Europe.</p>

        <p>This <strong>introducer-based model</strong> created room for some level of competition. Each city-state could issue its own patents to local introducers, allowing knowledge and skills to spread through the region. This is in sharp contrast to today’s global patent system, where protection is given to the
          <strong>original inventor</strong> and enforced across international borders—often with <strong>indefinite monopoly power</strong> through legal strategies like evergreening or chained patents.
        </p>

        <p>This introducer model remained the norm for most of patent history, lasting well into the First (1750–1840) and Second (1870–1914) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" target="_blank">Industrial Revolutions</a>. It was only replaced—at least in theory—by the principle of protection
          for the first inventor with the signing of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Industrial_Property" target="_blank">1883 Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property</a>. This was the first global patent treaty, signed by more than 180 countries. The
          agreement remains in force today, with many amendedments.</p>

        <p>In practice, however, some countries continued to <strong>ignore international patents</strong> well into the 20th century. They used foreign innovations freely to grow their own industries and job markets, as we will see in the next sections.</p>

        <p>Even during the era of introducer patents (we could generously consider 1474-1883), we can observe a trend: a <strong>gradual decline in competition</strong> as patent jurisdictions grew larger. What began as a decentralized system—city-states granting local patents—evolved into centralized national systems.
          This shift concentrated control, reduced competitive pressure between regions, and laid the groundwork for the monopolistic patent regimes we see today.</p>

      <h1>The First Patent-War Cycle: The Rise of the United States</h1>

      <div>

        <p>Our first case study: the rise of the United States as an economic and technological superpower.</p>

        <p>This section draws heavily from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trade-Secrets-Intellectual-American-Industrial-ebook/dp/B0014H4Z3G" target="_blank">Trade Secrets: Intellectual Piracy and the Origins of American Industrial Power by Doron S. Ben-Atar</a>, which is <strong>highly recommended
            reading</strong>.</p>

        <p>Up to and during the Industrial Revolution, <strong>European powers routinely stole technologies from one another</strong>. England, as the most industrially advanced nation of the era, was frequently the primary target of this technological piracy. In response, and to protect its economic lead, England
          developed a <strong>centralized national patent system</strong> and attempted to enforce it across its global territories—including the American colonies.</p>

        <p>However, the original thirteen American colonies had their own decentralized <strong>introducer-style patent systems</strong>. These systems were weakly enforced, colonial governments lacked the capacity—and often the will—to uphold any patent law, especially across the Atlantic. This gave local
          American industry a massive advantage: <strong>they were free to copy, adapt, and compete</strong> without the constraints that limited their British counterparts.</p>

        <p>This openness to innovation and competition directly fueled the <strong>economic rise of the American colonies</strong>. A climate of free-market invention and job creation attracted waves of migrants from the British Isles, drawn by the promise of opportunity. Many of these migrants were skilled specialists
          who brought with them not only valuable education and experience, but in some cases <strong>pirated machinery and trade secrets</strong>, worsening the brain drain from Britain and accelerating the colonies’ industrial growth.</p>

        <p>Over time, this economic strength enabled the loosely unified American states to build a more capable national government—one increasingly able to resist Britain’s overreach, including <strong>unfair and disproportionate taxation</strong>. As the colonies grew more confident and self-reliant, Britain
          attempted to reassert control—culminating in war. But this move backfired economically.</p>

        <p>Outside of the wars against Britain—including the Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and the so-called Second American War of Independence (1812–1815)—the United States at least paid lip service to British patent claims. But once Britain became a declared enemy, all such pretense vanished. <strong>British patents
            were openly and entirely ignored</strong>, unleashing a new wave of American innovation, accelerating industrial development, and generating massive job creation. This period demonstrated clearly how removing patent barriers during conflict can supercharge a nation’s economic engine.</p>

        <p>What makes the American case unique is that <strong>patent piracy was not isolated or incidental—it was systemic</strong>. All levels of American society took part in appropriating European, especially British, technology:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Individuals traveled to Britain to steal industrial secrets and return home to build factories.</li>
          <li>Cities offered incentives to British specialists to emigrate—often encouraging them to bring blueprints, know-how, and physical machinery.</li>
          <li>Private estates and industrialists funded mass migrations of skilled workers.</li>
          <li>The federal government itself organized campaigns to lure European talent and know-how to the United States.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This effort even involved many of America’s <strong>Founding Fathers and national leaders</strong>, who personally supported and facilitated patent piracy as a strategy for national growth.</p>

        <p>A striking example of American patent piracy was <strong>Samuel Slater</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Slater" target="_blank">an Englishman who arrived in New York in 1789</a>. As a former apprentice to a pioneer in Britain’s textile industry, Slater had <strong>memorized the designs
            of British textile machinery</strong>—technology that was protected by patents and subject to export bans under British law.</p>
        <p>Upon arriving in the United States, Slater used this knowledge to build the first successful U.S. textile mill, effectively jump-starting America’s industrial revolution by infringing on British intellectual property. For this act, he was later praised by President Andrew Jackson as the <strong>"Father of
            the American Industrial Revolution"</strong>. In contrast, British authorities branded him <strong>"Slater the Traitor"</strong>.</p>


        <p>America’s embrace of foreign inventions—regardless of its legal status—was no accident. It was openly encouraged at the highest levels of government. In his very first annual address to Congress in 1790, <strong>President George Washington</strong> <a
            href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-04-02-0361" target="_blank">made the following statement</a>:</p>
        <p class="quote">The advancement of Agriculture, commerce and Manufactures, by all proper means, will not, I trust, need recommendation. But I cannot forbear intimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well to the <strong>introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad</strong>,
          as to the exertions of skill and genius in producing them at home </p>

        <p><strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong>, one of America’s Founding Fathers and the first Secretary of the Treasury, was one of the main promoters of the use of foreign technology to boost domestic industry. In his 1791 <em>Report on the Subject of Manufactures</em> to Congress, <a
            href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-10-02-0001-0007" target="_blank">Hamilton stated his support for</a>:</p>

        <p class="quote">
          The encouragement of new inventions and discoveries, at home, and of the <strong>introduction</strong> into the United States of such as may have been <strong>made in other countries</strong>; particularly those, which relate to machinery. …
          <br />
          But it it is desireable in regard to improvements and secrets of extraordinary value, to be able to <strong>extend the same benefit to Introducers</strong>, as well as Authors and Inventors; <strong>a policy which has been practiced with advantage in other countries</strong>. …
          <br />
          Let these Commissioners be empowered to apply the fund confided to them—to defray [pay] the expences of the emigration of Artists, and Manufacturers in particular branches of extraordinary importance—to induce the prosecution and <strong>introduction</strong> of useful discoveries, inventions and
          improvements, by proportionate rewards
        </p>

        <p>American newspapers and books played a key role in spreading European inventions—<strong>not to respect them, but to teach Americans how to copy them</strong>. These publications acted as tools of open technological piracy, making foreign techniques accessible to local craftsmen and entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>One emblematic example is the appropriately named book <em>"<strong>One Thousand Valuable Secrets</strong>, in the Elegant and Useful Arts, Collected From the Practice of the Best Artists, and Containing an Account of the Various Methods of Engraving"</em>, published in 1795. This manual was unapologetic in
          its purpose. <a href="https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CB0131732946/ECCO?u=nla&sid=bookmark-ECCO&xid=e81955cd&pg=4" target="_blank">It explicitly stated</a>:</p>


        <p class="quote">
          Whilst the inhabitants of Europe are distracted by the din of arms [war], and their principal employment is to contrive the most expeditious means of destroying one another, let the happy citizens of these infant States turn their attention to the useful and elegant arts of peace; - <strong>let them avail
            themselves of the discoveries of these ancient nations</strong> in the happier years that are past; until we no longer stand in need of their supplies, or remain exposed to the fluctuations of their fortune.
          <br />
          The work now offered to the public is well calculated to promote this beneficial purpose, being a large and various collection of <strong>important secrets in the finer arts and trades; secrets which have resulted from repeated experiments made by the first artists in England, France, Italy and
            Germany</strong>, and which open an extensive field for the exercise of American ingenuity and improvement
        </p>

        <p>Eventually, Britain was forced to make peace and formally accept American independence—not only because of military setbacks, but also because it needed the United States as a geopolitical ally. More urgent threats were emerging in Europe, particularly the rise of the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Alliance">Holy Alliance</a> and the shifting balance of power on the continent.</p>

        <p>In summary, <strong>strict patent enforcement in Britain</strong> and <strong>lax enforcement in America</strong> allowed the United States to rapidly build its industrial base, stimulate economic prosperity, and ultimately gain the strength to confront Britain economically, and later, militarily. By
          leveraging unrestricted access to foreign technology, the U.S. transformed from a group of loosely connected colonies into an emerging industrial power.</p>

      <h1>The Second Patent-War Cycle: The rise of the Nazi</h1>
      <div>
        <p>After World War I (1914-1918), Germany began slowly rebuilding its economy. However, this fragile recovery was upended by the Great Depression (1929–1939), which triggered a global economic collapse. As nations scrambled to recover, many turned to protectionist policies—further disrupting international trade
          and deepening the crisis.</p>

        <p>Most historians agree that the prolonged economic devastation created by the Great Depression played a major role in the <strong>rise of the Nazi Party</strong>. What is less widely known is that strict patent enforcement played a significant factor in worsening the crisis.</p>

        <p>This concern was well articulated by Thurman Wesley Arnold, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, serving from 1938 to 1943. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1942/09/we-must-reform-the-patent-law/657291/" target="_blank">In
            his own words</a>:</p>

        <p class="quote">
          The latest and today the most extensively used instrument of monopoly control is the patent privilege ... <br />
          Where necessities are involved, there is no brake on this tendency, and exploitation by patent control is most effective in necessities like housing, fuel, drugs, and basic materials
        </p>

        <p>Arnold’s investigations revealed that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Companies across many industries</strong> were using patents to keep competitors at bay and enforce obedience from partner firms—even while holding questionable patents. Fear of legal retaliation discouraged any challenges.</li>
          <li><strong>Patents were used to artificially raise the cost of essential goods</strong>—including petrol and prescription glasses. These inflated input costs rippled through the economy, damaging industries and harming individuals.</li>
          <li><strong>Some German companies were using U.S. patents strategically</strong>. For example, they used American legal protections to raise the price of cutting-edge technologies such as tungsten carbide (second in hardness only to diamond), restricting access to these technologies in the United States while
            making them cheaply available in Germany.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This last point may have been a deliberate attempt to slow down technological adoption in rival nations, while enabling Nazi rearmament at home. By the time the U.S. entered World War II, it lacked the industrial ecosystem and trained workforce to take full advantage of these advanced technologies—largely
          because access to them had been choked off through international patent enforcement.</p>

        <p>The implications for national security are serious: historically and even today, <strong>patents can be weaponized against entire nations</strong>—used to delay technological adoption, restrict access to critical inventions, and undermine industrial development.</p>


        <p>Hitler’s rise was fueled in large part by fixing Germany’s job market—not through free markets, but through aggressive rearmament. The Nazi regime openly ignored foreign patents to accelerate the development of advanced weaponry, machinery, and industrial capacity. This gave Germany a significant
          technological and economic edge over its rivals, emboldening Hitler to invade Poland in 1939 and begin the Second World War.</p>

        <p>To fight Hitler effectively, Allied powers such as the United States and Britain were forced to abandon their own patent systems. Innovation and production needed to accelerate rapidly—and that meant removing legal roadblocks.</p>

        <p>In the U.S., this was accomplished through <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1498" target="_blank">Section 1498 of Title 28 of the U.S. Code</a>. This statute gave the federal government—and by extension its employees, contractors, and subcontractors— <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_patent_use_(United_States)" target="_blank">the legal authority to use any patented technology</a> without worrying about licensing, royalties, infringement lawsuits, or court injunctions.</p>

        <p>This legal maneuver allowed American industry to catch up technologically and ultimately defeat the Axis powers. But it had a secondary benefit: millions of people received both formal and experiential Education in cutting-edge technologies as part of the war effort.</p>

        <p>When the war ended, these workers transitioned into the private sector, applying their skills to build businesses and spark economic growth. This created the <a href="https://www.history.com/articles/1950s" target="_blank">Golden Age (50s and 60s)</a> in the United States, Britain, and even in some former
          Axis countries like Italy. </p>

        <p>The result was a thriving job market where the average citizen could afford to raise a family, buy a home, and begin fighting for civil rights and social progress—<strong>laying the foundation for many of the laws, institutions, and traditions that shape the modern world</strong>.</p>


        <p>However, strick patent enforcment returned post war, and as the knowledge of older tehcnologies were no longer useful as time passed, and newer tehcnologies were blocked by patents, this Golden Age ended around the late 60s and early 70s.</p>

        <p>This shift led to a now-infamous phenomenon: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_paradox" target="_blank">productivity paradox</a>—worker productivity continued to rise, but real wages stagnated. This divergence marked the beginning of many social and economic challenges that persist to
          this day; many of them are explored and documented on the website <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/" target="_blank">WTF Happened in 1971?</a></p>

        <p>In summary, <strong>strict patent enforcement in the US and Europe</strong> and <strong>lax enforcement in Germany</strong> allowed the Nazis to rapidly build its industrial base, stimulate economic prosperity, and ultimately gain the strength to intimidate and overpower other nations.
          The Allied nations were only able to defeat them by abandoning patent enforcement themselves, unleashing a wave of innovation and industrial production that allowed them to catch up technologically and stand a fighting chance.

      <h1>The Third Patent-War Cycle: The rise of the Soviet Union</h1>
      <div>
        <p>The rise of the Soviet Union as a technological superpower surprised much of the world. How could a nation without <strong>price signals, free markets, or private enterprise</strong> outperform capitalist countries in some of the most complex engineering and construction feats in history?</p>

        <p>The shock was global when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race" target="_blank">USSR launched Sputnik</a>, the first artificial satellite, into orbit in October 1957. That achievement was followed by a string of historic milestones, including sending the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space
          in April 1961. These victories forced Western powers to question how a centrally planned economy could pull so far ahead—at least temporarily—in the space and military technology race.</p>
        <p>One critical factor is often overlooked: the Soviet Union had basically abolished patents. Their leadership viewed patents as tools of capitalist exploitation—part of a system they sought to dismantle. Ironically, this ideological stance freed their economy from the very restrictions that continued to bind
          Western innovation. By removing legal barriers to technology sharing and adaptation, the Soviets unlocked fast-paced industrial replication and improvement.</p>

        <p>It is true that a tyrannical regime can divert massive resources to state projects in ways that democratic societies typically cannot. But that alone does not explain the Soviet advantage in the early years of the space race. Even after the U.S. began taking the competition seriously and ramped up spending,
          the USSR remained a strong competitor—longer than their inefficient economic model should have allowed.</p>

        <p>The cycle repeated itself when the United States decided to take the space race seriously. In response to Soviet achievements, the U.S. government poured vast resources into NASA. What is rarely mentioned in history books is that NASA operates under the protection of <a
            href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1498" target="_blank">Section 1498</a>, which allowed the agency to freely use any patented technology without needing to identify patent holders, negotiate licensing agreements, or pay royalties.</p>

        <p>In essence, NASA did what the Soviets had been doing all along: ignoring patents and focusing entirely on solving problems. The result was an explosion of innovation, economic activity, and job creation.</p>

        <p>Just the Apollo Program—aimed at landing a person on the Moon between 1968 and 1972—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Budget_of_NASA&oldid=1187066514" target="_blank">employed approximately 400,000 people at its peak</a>. This included engineers, scientists, mathematicians, technicians,
          astronauts, administrators, support staff, and contractors spread across NASA and numerous partner companies.
          The technological output was extraordinary. The program directly or indirectly led to groundbreaking innovations such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Portable defibrillators</li>
          <li>Computed axial tomography (CAT) scans</li>
          <li>Water purification systems</li>
          <li>Microprocessors</li>
          <li>Global Positioning System (GPS)</li>
          <li>Heat-resistant and fire-resistant materials</li>
          <li>Memory foam</li>
          <li>Breathing masks</li>
          <li>LED lighting</li>
          <li>Improved baby formula</li>
          <li>The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), which would later evolve into the modern internet</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Besides the space race, the U.S. government also leveraged its World War II strategy of funding university-led research and allowing private companies to freely commercialize the results—especially for military applications. A key hub in this system was Stanford University, under the leadership of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Terman" target="_blank">Frederick Terman</a>.</p>

        <p>This model laid the foundations of what would later become known as <em>Silicon Valley</em>: a military-industrial-university complex that carried out extensive, often classified, work for the U.S. government. Patent barriers were effectively ignored, enabling researchers and companies to focus entirely on
          solving hard problems. The result was a surge of technological innovation and a thriving economic ecosystem.</p>
        <p>The later invention of the transistor and the rise of the computer industry did not create Silicon Valley—they simply took advantage of the infrastructure and culture that had already been built through military and academic collaboration.</p>

        <p>Historian and entrepreneur Steve Blank has documented this little-known origin in his excellent blog series <a href="https://steveblank.com/secret-history/" target="_blank">The Secret History of Silicon Valley</a>, which is highly recommended reading.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, it was not just the missiles or astronauts that defeated the Soviet Union. It was the combined innovation of NASA and Silicon Valley—a decentralized, patent-free ecosystem of talent, experimentation, and rapid learning that the Soviet system could not replicate.</p>

        <p>However, this particular loop of the patent-war cycle produced an important and often overlooked side effect. During the Cold War, the world anticipated a potential World War III between the United States and the Soviet Union. As a result, many countries prepared for two key scenarios:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Armed conflict that they could be forced to participate in</li>
          <li>Trade disruption, especially through blockades or the collapse of global shipping and supply chains</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To prepare, governments maintained large, modernized military forces and often nationalized or tightly regulated key industries such as oil, steel, and telecommunications to ensure strategic independence. These efforts required close collaboration with national governments—an environment where patents were
          often ignored in the name of sovereignty and national security.</p>

        <p>The United States, while officially committed to patent protection, could not strongly enforce international patent rights in this climate. Pushing too hard on allies to respect U.S. or Western patents risked driving them into closer alignment with the Soviet bloc.</p>

        <p>This led to a period of <em>tacit U.S. tolerance of patent piracy</em>, especially in countries that had geopolitical value in the Cold War rivalry. These included:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>South Korea</strong>, recovering from the Korean War, positioned as a capitalist counterpoint to North Korea</li>
          <li><strong>Japan</strong>, rebuilding after World War II and located dangerously close to Soviet territory</li>
          <li><strong>Taiwan and Hong Kong</strong>, both flooded with refugees from Communist China and meant to showcase the strengths of market economies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In these key nations, patent piracy was not only tolerated—it was encouraged by tehir goverments- often under euphemisms like "copying" or "reverse engineering." This freedom to build upon foreign technologies without legal barriers fueled rapid industrial growth and innovation.</p>

        <p>This is the true reason why only these countries—unlike the rest of the post-war world—successfully transitioned into stable, developed economies. It was not simply cultural work ethic or good governance. It was because, for a critical window of time, they were allowed to innovate without the restrictions of
          the global patent regime.</p>

        <p>However, with the fall of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the common geopolitical enemy was defeated. This shifted the balance of power. The United States, along with developed European nations—many of whom had once thrived through patent piracy themselves—began to aggressively promote stronger and strict
          global patent enforcement.</p>

        <p>This push was embedded within a broader package of neoliberal reforms known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus" target="_blank">Washington Consensus</a>. These reforms included many valuable goals such as reducing bureaucracy, stabilizing economies, and increasing market
          competition. But they also contained a hidden trojan horse, the sweeping expansion and hardening of global patent system:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Expansion of patentable subject matter—including software, genetic material, and business methods</li>
          <li>Lengthened patent durations in many countries, often well beyond historical norms</li>
          <li>Mandatory strict legal frameworks for enforcing patent rights</li>
          <li>Severe <strong>restrictions on compulsory licensing</strong>, once a key tool for governments to protect public interest</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The most powerful instrument of this agenda was the 1994 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIPS_Agreement" target="_blank">Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)</a>, enforced through the World Trade Organization. TRIPS effectively forced developing countries to
          implement strict patent laws under threat of trade sanctions.</p>

        <p>Since the TRIPS agreement and other patent related treaties, many countries have experienced slower growth, rising inequality, and increasing market consolidation. Patent portfolios became not tools of innovation, but weapons of market control, allowing dominant firms to entrench their power and crush
          competition.</p>

        <p>While some claim that today’s patent system has been with us for centuries, that is misleading. The current model—with global scope, long duration, strict enforcement, and negligible use of compulsory licenses—only emerged after 1991. It is a recent construction, born from post–Cold War politics, not
          historical tradition.</p>

        <p>In fact, for most of modern history, the true tradition has been weak patents, limited enforcement, or no patent system at all—especially during key historical moments of technological progress, economic recovery, and job creation.</p>

        <p>In summary, <strong>strict patent enforcement in the United States</strong> and the <strong>absence of patent restrictions in the Soviet Union</strong> allowed the Soviets to rapidly build their industrial base and gain the strength to intimidate and challenge other nations—despite the inherent flaws of
          their planned economy.
          The United States was only able to defeat them by abandoning patent enforcement themselves. This shift unleashed a surge of innovation and industrial production—most notably in Silicon Valley and NASA—which enabled the U.S. to catch up technologically and ultimately outcompete the Soviet Union.

      <h1>The Fourth Patent-War Cycle: The rise of the Modern China</h1>
      <div>

        <p>With the United States emerging from the Cold War as the sole military, economic, and technological superpower, no nation dared to challenge its push for strict global patent enforcement. That is, except for the one country large and independent enough to chart its own course: China.</p>

        <p>China embarked on an ambitious program of modernization and integration into the global economy, including joining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_the_World_Trade_Organization" target="_blank">World Trade Organization in 2001</a>. But China’s path to technological advancement followed a
          familiar pattern — the same path once taken by Britain and the United States during the Industrial Revolution, and by South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong during the Cold War.</p>

        <p>That path was built on widespread patent piracy. By allowing companies and individuals to copy and learn from foreign technologies without the burden of licensing fees or legal risks, China created space for its industries to grow independently. This allowed its firms to avoid dependence on foreign
          multinationals holding vast and overlapping patent portfolios across nearly every conceivable sector.</p>

        <p>Initially, much of this development came through offshoring—as Western firms relocated manufacturing to China. But over time, this evolved into imitation, as Chinese firms gained hands-on experience (experiential Education) with production. Eventually, that imitation matured into genuine innovation.</p>


        <p>Interestingly, in many ways, <strong>Chinese patent piracy is quite literally helping to save the world</strong>. While often criticized, its practical consequences have produced tangible global benefits—particularly in areas where Western economies are stagnating under the weight of oligopolies and patent
          barriers.</p>

        <p>Here are three key ways this dynamic plays out:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Relief from global inflation.</strong> Many industries around the world are dominated by oligopolies backed by massive patent portfolios. These firms often exploit their lack of competition by increasing prices while reducing product quality or quantity. Governments, in turn, attempt to fix their
            economy with monetary expansion, contributing to persistent inflation. But China’s internal markets remain highly competitive, in part because widespread patent litigation is not used to drive firms out of business. As a result, Chinese firms produce vast quantities of affordable goods, providing critical
            cost relief to the global middle and working classes.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Acceleration of green technology.</strong> While many wealthy nations have made only symbolic gestures toward fighting climate change, real action is often blocked by patent disputes. Dominant firms with vested interests frequently hold key patents that prevent or delay the deployment of disruptive
            green technologies. Meanwhile, oil-rich regimes—many with poor human rights records—gain wealth and geopolitical power by supplying energy to a dependent world. Fortunately, China’s willingness to ignore restrictive patents has enabled the mass production of green technologies like solar panels, wind
            turbines, batteries, electric vehicles, and high-speed rail systems. These technologies are now world-class, providing an alternative path that helps address both climate change and geopolitical dependence on autocracies.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Revitalization of innovation and job creation.</strong> Innovation is a critical engine of job creation. In a healthy market, companies are forced to innovate and hire in order to keep pace with their competitors. However, in patent-protected oligopolies, firms often suppress disruptive technologies
            to protect outdated infrastructure and maximize profit. This is not capitalism—it is monopoly capitalism sustained by legal privilege. China’s competitive industries, such as smartphones, cars and televisions, have injected much-needed pressure into stagnant Western markets, forcing incumbent firms to
            innovate and compete. This has led to real job creation and has helped soften the crisis of disappearing middle-class employment in the West.
          </li>
        </ul>


        <p>It is important to recognize that China’s approach is not driven by altruism. Much like <a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/quotes/adam-smith-butcher-brewer-baker" target="_blank">Adam Smith’s famous baker</a>, China acts in its own self-interest. Its strategy of rapid industrialization—based in large part on ignoring foreign patents—has produced extraordinary results. By leveraging this approach, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/04/01/lifting-800-million-people-out-of-poverty-new-report-looks-at-lessons-from-china-s-experience" target="_blank">China has lifted nearly 800 million people out of extreme poverty</a>, accounting for approximately 75% of the global reduction in poverty over the past few decades.</p>

        <p>However, this economic success comes with serious caveats. China’s record on minority rights and civil liberties remains deeply problematic. As China grows more powerful, it has also grown more assertive geopolitically—while much of the rest of the world struggles with stagnation, inequality, and political instability. In many countries, this is fueling the rise of demagogues and extreme ideologies.</p>
        
        <p>These conditions—an aggressive rising power on one side and weakened, polarized societies on the other—are once again stirring talks of a major war.  Fortunately, we are not there yet. We still have a chance to break the cycle that has defined modern history: the recurring loop of patents, economic decay, extremism, and war.</p>
        
        <p>If the global community were to <b>abolish the patent system</b>, the results could be transformative. SMEs would flourish, unburdened by threats of litigation. Large companies would be forced to unleash all the technologies they have been suppressing and flood global markets with useful products and services, to proactively prevent competitors from doing it first.</p>
        <p>This would lead to factories and offices opening across diverse regions, and competition would drive down prices while improving quality. The result would be a massive surge in job creation, helping the global economy stabilize and reducing the appeal of demagogues.</p>
        
        <p>More importantly, innovation and economic prosperity would no longer be exclusive to countries willing to disregard human rights. Instead, ethical and reputable producers everywhere could compete on equal footing. This shift would weaken the monopoly power of authoritarian regimes and strengthen the moral and economic influence of open societies. Over time, it could even pressure abusive governments to reform from within.</p>
