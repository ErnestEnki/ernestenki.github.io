      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <div>
        <p>The news is full of reports of wars, trade disputes between countries. All of this while we put satellites in space, and create Artificial Intelligences that were once considered impossible.
          In one area, we are going backwards, returning to an era of agressivity that we once thought humanity had matured from. In the other hand, we have amazing developments being our wildest dreams. 
          Everyday people is left wonderinng how can this dichotomy stand, and the root causes of it.
          </p>

        <p>This discussion builds on a section from my earlier book, <a href="/books/patent_dystopia/summary.html" target="_blank">Patent Dystopia</a>, which explored the modern history, the nature of innovation and, and what business and war have in common. .</p>

      <h1>Similarities between business and war</h1>

      <div>
        <p>Business and war share a core purpose: they both <strong>compete</strong> for resources:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Businessess compete via <u>creation</u></strong>, by selling produts and services for money, which they can use to purchase the resources they desire.</li>
          <li><strong>War competes via <u>destruction</u></strong>, by threatening or causing damage to force other parties to hand over the resources they desire.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I posit that military competition arises from the lack of business competition, as the lack a healthy job market leads to few and poorly paid jobs, stressing the population, who become more prone to demagogues, overreactions, taking offenses; which ultimately lead to war.</p>

        <p>Secondly, we posit a bad job market is largely the result of a stricly enforced patent system, which allows big companies to form oligopolies, by preemptively patents useful technologies, buidling huge patent portfolios, which tehy use to 
          kill SMEs, which <a href="https://doi.org/10.1787/34907e9c-en" target="_blank">comprise a staggering 99% of businesses and contribute 60% of employment in OECD countries.</a>
        </p>

        <p>Interestingly, the military and the marketplace share many parallels, not only in the big picture, but also the very mechanisms for job creation.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>In the military, when a new enemy appears, governments always find money for bombs and warplanes, even if they previously claimed to have no funds for essentials like schools and hospitals. Ultimately, this surge of activity generates many jobs.
            <br/>
            Similarly, in a true free market (without patents), when a formidable competitor emerges, companies suddenly allocate funds for large R&D projects. They offer salary raises to retain key employees and invest in expensive marketing campaigns, even if they previously claimed to have no money for basics like cost-of-living raises or replacing employees who had left—while still rewarding shareholders handsomely. Ultimately, this surge of activity generates many jobs.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the military, governments employ many intelligence staff to gather enemy information, develop military strategies, spread propaganda, and try to recruit enemies to their side. Ultimately, this surge of activity generates many jobs.
            <br/>
            Similarly, in a true free market (without patents), companies employ numerous staff in intelligence: gathering competitor information, creating market strategies, engaging in marketing, and attempting to recruit competitors' staff. Ultimately, this surge of activity generates many jobs.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the military, a vast number of soldiers serve as the tip of the spear, pushing into enemy territory to achieve victory. Ultimately, this surge of activity generates many jobs.
            <br/>
            Similarly, in a true free market (without patents), a vast number of salespeople, evangelists, public relations managers, and others act as the tip of the spear in the marketplace, pushing into competitor markets to gain industry dominance. Ultimately, this surge of activity generates many jobs.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the military, there is a need for engineers, researchers, and scientists to develop new technologies to defeat the enemy. Ultimately, this surge of activity generates many jobs.
            <br/>
            Similarly, in a true free market (without patents), companies likewise create numerous positions for engineers, researchers, and scientists to develop new technologies to outperform competitors. Ultimately, this surge of activity generates many jobs.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the military, enemy bombs destroy a country’s assets such as bridges, roads, and airplanes. This creates the need for cleanup, recycling of what remains, and reconstruction of replacements. Ultimately, this surge of activity generates many jobs.
            <br/>
            Similarly, in a true free market (without patents), competitors' innovations destroy the market relevance of a company’s assets such as products, services, internal tools and machinery, and marketing strategies; by making them obsolete. This creates the need for cleanup, recycling of what remains, and reconstruction of replacements that are more market relevant. Ultimately, this surge of activity generates many jobs.
          </li>
        </ul>           

         <p>As <a href="https://fee.org/resources/if-goods-dont-cross-borders/" target="_blank">Bastiat once said</a>: <em>When goods don’t cross borders, soldiers will</em> </p>

         <p>This parallels are not a coincidence, the military creates jobs EXACTLY because they ignore patents, unleashing <strong>innovation</strong> and <strong>competition</strong> between nations, which are the major forces of job creation.</p>

      <h1>A short history of patents and war</h1>

      <div>

        <p>No nation would dare to respect that patent system during war, as the effort to find all teh patent holders to ask permission to use their tech, let alone paying royalties, would be a major waste of time and money, and give 
          advantage to enemy nations that don't follow this foolish path.</p>
        
        <p>Examples are <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1498" target="_blank">Section 1498</a>, which grants US federal government (including its employees, contractors, and subcontractors) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_patent_use_(United_States)" target="_blank">freedom to use any patented technology</a> without worrying about licenses, royalties, infringement claims, or court orders. Notably, government employees, contractors and subcontractors do not need explicit authorization from the government, as permission can be implied under appropriate circumstances. </p>
        <p>Another example are the <a href="https://www.wipo.int/scp/en/exceptions/replies/israel.html#Q9">Israel  compulsory licenses and/or goverment use of patents</a></p>

        <p>Let us review modern history of war from the point of view of strict vs lax tax enforcement:</p>

        <p>The Great Depression (1929-1939) was a major economic crisis that greatly changed human history. For example, Germany was struggling to recover under the burdens of the treaties post WW1, but it was not doing badly.
          The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party" target="_blank">Nazi party</a> was created in 1920, whoever they were not taken seriously by the population. 
          In an election in 1924, they got only 3% of the votes, and in another election 1928, this fell to only this fell to 2.6%. They had similarly negligible numbers in state elections.
          But the Great Depression created mass unemployment and widespread business failures. The result is that in a September 1930 Federal election, the Nazis won 18% of the votes and became the second-largest party in the country.
          From there, the rise of the Nazis and their attrocities is well document in history books.
           </p>

        <p>A good question is what caused the great depression, and why it lasted so long?</p>

        <p>Much academic research went into answers, which coalesced around financial system fragility and policy failures. However I posit there was another major factor: strict enforcment of patents.</p>

        <p>This problem was detected and well elaborated on by the a US assistant attorney general (Thurman Arnold), in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1942/09/we-must-reform-the-patent-law/657291/" target="_blank">an article at The Atlantic</a>, which the reader is recommended to read in full, if you are prepared to feel outraged, otherwise these are some interesting parts:</p>

        <em>
          <p>The latest and today the most extensively used instrument of monopoly control is the patent privilege. … </p>
          <p>Ethyl Corporation got the power of life or death over 11,000 jobbers [fuel wholesalers]. It could put any one of them out of business without cause by revoking his license to sell his own unpatented gasoline if 1/4200 of that gasoline was ethyl fluid. <strong>This is not industrial democracy, it is dictatorship</strong>... </p>
          <p>The shaky patent was therefore never contested, and the public was gouged to the tune of $150,000,000 a year. Moreover, when the price is fixed on a necessity the actual cost goes beyond the direct cost. If you are an average citizen getting $2000 a year or less and the Ethyl Corporation adds $25 to your gasoline bill, the only place you can get that $25 is from your food budget. So you buy less farm products. Transportation costs also go up, increasing the spread between the farm and your table. The farmers lose a part of their market. Then the government must step in and subsidize the distribution of food, and the gasoline user, who must pay a higher fuel bill, must also pay more taxes in order to pay back the subsidy. All this happens when patent cartels control the price of necessities...</p>
          <p>Where necessities are involved, there is no brake on this tendency, and exploitation by patent control is most effective in necessities like housing, fuel, drugs, and basic materials. </p>
        </em>

        <p>In essence, abuse of the patent system made the Great Depression more severe and last longer, enabling the rise of authoritation goverments in Europe.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, during the German militarization period, as it sneakly prepared to invade tehir neighbors, it obviousyl chose to ignore patents to product the latest weapornry and technology, and to do so at a low price. 
          The initial success of the Nazi party was due exactly becaues they created jobs by ignoring patents.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <div>

        concerning as  <a href="protectionism_tariffs_jobs" target="_blank">protectionsim and tariffs make a comeback</a>

        many countries of the past, who defended their natural resources by tooth and nail,  would be appalled by the beahviour of their modern leaders, who are happy to sell their natural resources to foreign countries.
