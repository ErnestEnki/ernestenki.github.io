      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Anyone paying attention to current events has reason to worry about the future of work. Artificial intelligence is replacing tasks once done by humans, and robots are steadily taking over factories. If these trends continue, key questions emerge:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Will there be enough jobs for everyone?</li>
          <li>What will future jobs look like?</li>
          <li>How can individuals and societies prepare?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This discussion builds on a section of my earlier book, <a href="/books/patent_dystopia/summary.html" target="_blank">Patent Dystopia</a>, which examined the past, present, and future of AI and robotics.</p>

        <p>Disclaimer: we will assume that technology continues progressing at its current pace, but that fully sentient AI remains either far off or impossible for reasons not yet understood. If true general AI ever arrives, all bets are off.</p>

        <p>Of course, my guesses are as good as any, but hopefully they will open the readers mind a little bit.</p>

      <h1>The Rise of R&AIs: Robots and AIs</h1>

      <div>
        <p>The future is already here—it is just not evenly distributed. Let us explore how key forces already shaping a few corners of industry will soon spread across most sectors and into everyday life.</p>

        <h2>Faster Feedback Loops</h2>
        <div>
          <p>AI is advancing faster than robotics because its feedback loop is much shorter. An AI model can train and be evaluated millions of times per second using automated systems—like another AI or hard-coded evaluators—in a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network"
              target="_blank">Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</a>. This happens in highly parallelized computing environments, allowing rapid improvement.</p>

          <p>Robots, by contrast, face a slow, physical feedback loop. Training a chef robot to fry an egg, for example, means actually frying an egg—a process that takes minutes. Some evaluation can be automated using AI vision to spot undercooked or burnt results, but final assessment often requires a human, adding
            delays.</p>

          <p>However that gap is shrinking. Robots are increasingly trained in fast, physics-based virtual simulations. These “rehearsals” allow embedded AIs to iterate quickly, like the “paint the fence” drills in The Karate Kid. Once an AI performs well in simulation, it can transfer its skills to the real
            world—already several steps ahead.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Remotely Operated Robots</h2>
        <div>
          <p>A major trend that often escapes public attention is the rise of remotely operated—or teleoperated—robots.</p>
          <p>This shift has been unfolding quietly within industry, largely outside the view of everyday life. A prime example is Rio Tinto’s mining operations, where robots are controlled remotely to handle heavy machinery, transport materials, and navigate hazardous environments:</p>

          <div>
            <iframe width="880" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgeHOZHkAOU" frameborder="0" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>

          <p>But robots are not just limited to industrial settings. They are beginning to enter everyday life as well. One of the most striking examples is the Optimus robot, which has been remotely operated to work as a bartender—serving drinks, interacting with customers, and performing tasks typically handled by
            human staff. Note: At first, these robots were marketed as AI-driven. However, it was later clarified by Optimus that they were largely controlled through remote operation:</p>
          <div>
            <iframe width="600" height="701" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/agrfdLcE8qc" frameborder="0" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>

          <p>This development will initially benefit workers. For example, miners will be able to operate robots from a safe, comfortable location—far from the dangerous conditions of mining sites, which include cave-ins, inhalation of hazardous particles, and extreme heat.</p>

          <p>Even in less hazardous jobs, remote operation will be a net positive. A high-end bartender in New York City, for instance, would no longer need to live in an expensive apartment or endure long commutes. Instead, they could live in a spacious home near family in a much more affordable region and work from
            there—using a VR headset, haptic gloves, and other remote control tools to operate a humanoid robot behind the bar.</p>

          <p>In the early stages, these robots will be controlled by the same professionals who once performed those jobs in person. Their experience will make them well-suited to guide the robots as the technology matures.</p>

          <p>In the second phase, companies will begin to ask a simple question: if robots can be teleoperated from anywhere, why continue paying high wages to local workers?</p>
          <p>This realization will trigger a new wave of offshoring. Roles such as cooks, cleaners, construction workers, elderly caregivers, and factory operators will increasingly be filled by robots operated remotely from lower-wage regions—most likely in the developing world.</p>

          <p>Alongside this, companies will notice another opportunity. Since every teleoperated interaction can be fully recorded—using cameras, motion sensors, and other data streams—they can capture both the environment and the human response in precise detail. These massive datasets will then be used to train AI
            systems in virtual simulations, allowing them to gradually learn and mimic human performance.</p>

          <p>In the third phase, AI will begin taking over more and more tasks from human teleoperators. These systems will have learned from observing many human interactions and can begin automating the most repetitive and predictable parts of the job. This marks the real convergence of robotics and artificial
            intelligence—what we can call the era of R&AI.</p>

          <p>Given the widespread presence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Paretto Principle</a> in the world, it is reasonable to expect that R&AI systems will eventually be able to perform around 80% of the tasks in most jobs. However, the remaining 20%—the edge
            cases—will still require human intervention. These are unusual or complex scenarios that machines cannot yet handle. While full automation of even these outliers is theoretically possible, it will take significantly more time and effort.</p>

          <p>The result is the emergence of a new type of job: the <b>"remoter"</b>. This is a human operator who supervises and manages multiple R&AIs, potentially in a variety of robot body types. Much like a senior employee oversees junior staff, a remoter watches over fleets of robots, intervening only when
            necessary.</p>

          <p>Take the restaurant industry as an example. A single human chef may monitor a network of robot cooks across several kitchens. The remoter can pause any robot, take over control, or override decisions. If an uncontrolled flame is detected, the human can take over and operate the fire extinguisher. If water
            stops running, the remoter can investigate the building’s water system or call the utility company.</p>

          <p>R&AI systems will also be programmed to ask for help when needed. If a robot encounters a situation it was not trained for—like opening multiple rotten eggs—it will pause and request human support. The remoter will receive a queue of such intervention requests. When it is that robot’s turn, the human might
            take control, inspect the remaining eggs, dispose of the spoiled ones, check the refrigeration system, and then return the robot to normal automated operation.</p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <h1>The Great Automation</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Faster feedback loops in AI are enabling machines to take over many white-collar tasks. At the same time, robots—once limited by slow physical learning—are improving rapidly. Simulated environments now allow them to practice and learn much faster. Combined with the growing use of teleoperation, R&AIs
          (Robots + AIs) are becoming capable of replacing blue-collar work as well.</p>
        <p>Together, these forces point to a historic shift that future generations may call The Great Automation—a period when most jobs are either partially or completely automated, with far fewer workers needed to do the same work as before.</p>
        <p>If society fails to prepare, the result could be massive unemployment or underemployment. Governments and voters may panic and respond with ineffective or harmful policies: trade wars, military aggression, scapegoating immigrants, or even the rise of extremist ideologies and hyper-religious movements.
          History suggests that when people feel economically powerless, they search for answers in all the wrong places.</p>
        <p>There is a better path forward. One of the most important steps governments can take is to abolish the patent system, as <a href="/books/patent_dystopia/summary.html">I discussed in my book</a>. Patents have become a major obstacle to job creation. They block small and mid-sized companies from competing
          and prevent useful innovation from reaching the market. In a time when automation is destroying jobs faster than ever, we must remove the barriers that block the creation of new jobs and industries.</p>
        <p>We need more competition and innovation to create entirely new kinds of jobs—ones that can replace those lost to automation</p>
      </div>

      <h1>Jobs of the Future: Remoters and Researchers</h1>
      <div>
        <p>In the future, most jobs will fall into two broad categories: remoters and researchers. As R&AIs take over repetitive and derivative tasks, only the most complex and creative responsibilities will remain in human hands.</p>

        <p>For blue-collar workers, this shift means becoming remoters—people who monitor and occasionally take control of robotic systems when something goes wrong. They will step in to perform difficult tasks that the R&AI cannot yet handle, then return the system to automated mode.</p>

        <p>For white-collar workers, the future lies in research. Their job will be to create new <strong>knowledge, inventions, original content, or art</strong>—work that cannot be easily automated. These outputs will be bundled into modular “AI-packs,” which can be sold in a marketplace similar to an app store. </p>

        <p>Owners of R&AIs will purchase these AI-packs, integrate them into their knowledge and skills, and replicate the results across society. Each AI-pack might also include instructions or links to human remoters who can assist with tasks that remain too complex or unpredictable for automation.</p>

        <p>AI-packs will be sold as one-time purchases or via subscriptions that offer ongoing updates. This model will allow researchers to earn predictable income while R&AIs continue expanding the reach of their ideas.</p>

        <p>This new division of labor—remoters solving edge-case problems and researchers pushing the boundaries of innovation—will define the structure of work in the age of advanced automation.</p>

        <p>The researchers of the future will build specialized solutions that R&AIs can replicate at scale. Examples could include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Wind turbines optimized for low-wind regions</li>
          <li>Language learning methods tailored to personality types</li>
          <li>Eldercare plans combining mobility, diabetes, and memory support</li>
          <li>Therapy frameworks adapted to specific cultures</li>
          <li>Agricultural systems for rooftops or arid climates</li>
          <li>New artistic styles for robotic painters and photographers portray their owners important moments.</li>
          <li>Producing custom prosthetics for rare anatomical conditions</li>
          <li>Educational strategies for children with dual diagnoses (e.g., autism and dyslexia)</li>
          <li>Materials that biodegrade under specific environmental conditions</li>
          <li>Diet plans for rare metabolic disorders</li>
          <li>Robots trained in sign language or eye-tracking for caregiving tasks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>One thing that both of these future job categories—<strong>remoter</strong> and <strong>researcher</strong>—will have in common is the disappearance of entry-level roles. Traditional junior positions will be absorbed by R&AIs, which can handle routine and repetitive tasks more efficiently than humans. As a
          result, most available jobs will require a senior level of expertise and mastery within a specific domain.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, R&AIs will not only replace junior roles but also serve as powerful tools to help individuals <strong>accelerate</strong> their learning. These systems can teach concepts, generate practice material, evaluate understanding, and adaptively guide learners—functioning as personal teachers. This
          will empower individuals to achieve senior-level competence faster than ever before.</p>

        <p>However, this new work environment will present psychological and interpersonal challenges, especially for researchers. They will find themselves surrounded by R&AIs in three distinct roles:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Above:</strong> R&AIs will act as <strong>teachers</strong>, offering structured lessons, correcting mistakes, and delivering feedback. This will require individuals to remain humble and open to guidance—even from a machine.</li>
          <li><strong>Alongside:</strong> R&AIs will serve as <strong>collaborators</strong>, helping with research, running simulations, analyzing data, and providing strategic suggestions. Success here will require strong communication, coordination, and leadership skills—treating AIs as integral parts of a
            research team.</li>
          <li><strong>Below:</strong> R&AIs will function as <strong>subordinates</strong>, executors of instructions, following human-created plans or being temporarily controlled by remoters. Researchers will need to break down knowledge into clear, actionable steps, using their managerial and instructional
            abilities to effectively direct automated agents.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h1>Alternative Futures</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Let us now explore a few alternative future scenarios that others have proposed. These predictions come from a mix of economists, futurists, technologists, and science fiction writers. Each offers a distinct view of how automation, artificial intelligence, and economic structures might evolve—and how
          humanity might adapt or fail to do so.</p>

        <h2>Unemployment and Underemployment</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Some believe the future will be marked by massive unemployment, where most people are forced into underemployment—accepting gig work, temporary or part-time jobs, or steep salary cuts. This may indeed happen at first, as companies use R&AIs to automate existing roles.</p>
          <p>However, it is important to remember what actually creates jobs: <strong>competition</strong> and <strong>innovation</strong>.</p>
          <p>Competition pushes standards higher. When companies automate part of their operations, they free up resources to innovate and differentiate themselves. This leads to new roles being created. This principle applies both to individuals competing for status and businesses competing for customers. For
            example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Washing Machines:</strong> The introduction of washing machines reduced the time required to do laundry. Previously, laundry might take four hours per load; today, it takes just over 40 minutes. <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21523419/laundry-hate-chore-washing-machine" target="_blank">But
                total laundry time has <strong>not</strong> dropped significantly</a>—people wash clothes more frequently, and own more larger wardrobes. As people compete socially, cleanliness and varied clothing become status markers, creating more work, not less.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ATMs:</strong> When ATMs were introduced, many feared bank teller jobs would vanish. Instead, competition between banks forced them to introduce more complex and personalized services to stand out, requiring human representatives to explain and manage these new offerings. Even the ATM itself
              also became a job generator—new roles emerged for updating security and adding features.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Innovation also drives job creation through what I described in <a href="/books/patent_dystopia/summary.html" target="_blank">my book</a> as the <strong>Four Horsemen of Creative Destruction</strong>. Let us consider them through the example of websites:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Breakthroughs:</strong> These are new possibilities that suddenly open up, pushing companies to act adopt them to outpace their competittors. When the internet became widespread, every business needed a website to compete.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Complexity:</strong> These are competing technologies and standards that emerge, forcing companies must stay compatible with many of them. For example, as social media platforms rose, businesses had to maintain a presence across multiple channels.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Obsolescence:</strong> These are newer technologies that render old ones outdated, forcing companies to upgrade. The rise of smartphones made it necessary for websites to be mobile-friendly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trends:</strong> These include changing design styles, language, and customer expectations. To avoid looking outdated, companies must frequently refresh their websites and brand presence.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>These forces are especially visible in fast-moving industries like software, where patents are rare and innovation thrives. But they also apply, in lesser intensity, across other sectors—like automotive, healthcare, real estate, and consumer goods.</p>

          <p><strong>In summary:</strong> widespread unemployment or underemployment is not inevitable—so long as we encourage competition and innovation. <a href="/books/patent_dystopia/summary.html" target="_blank">Abolishing the patent system</a> would remove the biggest structural barrier preventing new ideas
            from arising and SMEs from creating jobs. Until such structural reforms are made, we will experience worsening job conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>R&AI Economic Consequences</h2>
        <div>

          <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vinod-khosla-universal-basic-income-ai-job-loss-2024-9" target="_blank">Some people</a>, argue that Universal Basic Income (UBI) may be necessary to cope with widespread job loss due to R&AI.</p>
          <p>However, UBI is unlikely to work if it is rolled out to large portions of the population. It would likely fuel inflation.</p>
          <p>The United Kingdom’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_to_Buy" target="_blank">"Help to Buy"</a> program aimed to support first-time homebuyers, but critics argued it inflated housing prices. The IMF and the Bank of England warned that the scheme risked triggering a housing bubble by boosting
            demand without addressing supply shortages.</p>

          <p>Another example was the massive amount of money governments printed to manage the COVID-19 crisis, both in the <a href="https://mises.org/power-market/how-much-did-they-print" target="_blank">U.S.</a> and <a href="https://www.voronoiapp.com/economy/Money-Supply-Growth-in-Major-Economies-20192023-688"
              target="_blank">other countries</a>. This resulted in significant inflation in the following years—even after supply adjusted—proving that supply limitations worsen inflation, but are not a requirement for it to occur.</p>

          <p>An important consequence is that <strong>R&AI will probably cause an economic crash</strong>, if measured by GDP or tax revenue. This may seem unintuitive, but it is the natural result of a sharp drop in the price of most goods and services, as they become cheaper to produce through R&AI.</p>
          <p>In reality, the economy will be far more productive, but because we still rely on primitive measures like GDP to track economic health, it will appear as if the economy is getting worse, even when it is not.</p>
          <p>Without the creation of new products and services that are hard to automate—and therefore remain expensive—governments will struggle to collect tax revenue. They will be forced to print money to fund UBI or other support programs, which leads to more inflation.</p>
          <p>Targeted support programs like UBI can be useful—but only when given to a small percentage of the population and when supply can scale with demand. Otherwise, inflation will erase the benefits.</p>

          <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> There is no shortcut around the future of work. When R&AIs destroy jobs, we must unleash competition and innovation to create new ones. It is the only sustainable path to prosperity in the age of R&AI.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Post-Work Society</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Some argue that R&AI will create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-work_society" target="_blank">post-work society</a>, where all our needs are met by machines and we no longer need to work.</p>

          <p>This scenario might become reality if R&AIs reach sentience and can perform any human task. However, as mentioned earlier, we are not assuming this will happen.</p>
          <p>Another version of this argument claims that even without sentience, R&AIs will be smart enough to produce most goods and services we require, such as food and basic health care. With our basic needs covered, work would no longer be necessary.</p>
          <p>However, this belief overlooks two psychological patterns:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.calm.com/blog/arrival-fallacy" target="_blank">Arrival Fallacy</a>:</strong> The illusion that reaching a goal will bring lasting happiness or fulfillment.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/hedonic-treadmill/" target="_blank">Hedonic Adaptation</a>:</strong> The human tendency to return to a baseline level of happiness shortly after positive or negative changes.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If a post-work society were truly satisfying, we would already see widespread adoption. Many people today live with more comfort than their great-grandparents could have imagined. Basic food and health care are affordable in many places, requiring little work to maintain. And yet, most people do not choose
            a
            minimalist lifestyle.</p>
          <p>There are exceptions—some choose to live in ashrams, kibbutzim, or similar communities, trading work for food, lodging, and participation in communal life. But most people are not satisfied with just the basics.</p>

          <p>We want more—new smartphones, travel to exotic places, tennis lessons, gourmet meals, trendy clothes, and other markers of personal growth or status. R&AIs may commoditize many goods and services, making them cheaper and more accessible. But over time, these will become the new baseline. The desire for
            more
            will remain.</p>
          <p>R&AIs might reduce the number of hours we need to work, especially for those content with a simpler life. But it is unlikely they will eliminate work altogether or even in large parts. Human nature drives us to grow, strive, and improve—and that will always require work.</p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <h1>Preparing for the R&AI Age</h1>
      <div>
        <p>In light of these considerations, how should individuals and governments prepare for the upcoming era of R&AI?</p>

        <h3>Individuals</h3>
        <p>Individuals should learn: <strong>How to Work with AIs</strong>, and <strong>Areas of Exclusive Mastery</strong></p>

        <p>The first step is learning how to make the best use of AIs—understanding their strengths, adapting them to your needs, and recognizing their limits. Human-AI interaction happens in three directions, and each one requires separate practice:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Above:</strong> Receiving instructions from AI to learn new knowledge/skills or improve existing ones.</li>
          <li><strong>Alongside:</strong> Collaborating with AI as a partner in your creative or analytical projects.</li>
          <li><strong>Below:</strong> Delegating tasks to AI, so it handles repetitive or derivative work while you focus on higher-level thinking.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>R&AIs will dominate well-documented, repetitive, and common tasks. To remain valuable, individuals must pursue skills that are rare, complex, or evolving. These areas, that few have mastered, will tend to fall into two categories:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hyper-Specialization:</strong> Becoming an expert in a very narrow field. Examples:
            <ul>
              <li>Instead of learning general cooking, specialize in rare areas like barbecuing or exotic mushrooms.</li>
              <li>Instead of being a general frontend developer, master accessible web design for users with vision impairments.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Hyper-Generalization:</strong> Gaining working knowledge in many fields to understand how parts fit together and evaluate AI-generated work. Examples:
            <ul>
              <li>Instead of focusing only on savory dishes, understand full meal design—nutrition, flavor balance, and complementary beverages.</li>
              <li>Instead of focusing on frontend programming, become a “webmaster” who oversees and integrates design, accessibility, SEO, database and content strategy.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Those caught in the middle—neither highly specialized nor broadly knowledgeable—are most at risk, as their work is often easy to document, repeat, and automate.</p>

        <p>Finally, individuals must pressure governments to take action. Without policy changes, the benefits of R&AI may be hoarded by a few powerful organizations.</p>
      </div>

      <h1>A Typical Day in the Future</h1>
      <div>
        <p>These forces will create a future that feels like paradise for those with reasonably well-paying jobs, due to factors like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As R&AIs reduce labor costs—often the largest expense for companies—the price of goods and services will drop significantly.</li>
          <li>Even homes will have access to humanoid robots, or <strong>butlerbots</strong>, capable of handling most household tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's imagine how a typical day in this future might look like:</p>

        <p>You wake up to the smell of freshly baked bread and coffee—part of your meal plan that you scheduled your butlerbot to prepare. It synced the preparation with your alarm, so breakfast is hot and ready.</p>

        <p>Walking to the kitchen, you see the home already cared for: vacuumed, dusted, mopped, and tidied. Garbage has been sorted, laundry done, your cat’s litter box is clean, and its food bowl is full. Your butlerbot silently passes you to tidy your bedroom—just as you programmed it.</p>

        <p>As you eat breakfast, you check the butlerbot nightly report. The robot scanned the home for issues like leaks or faulty wiring, monitored inventory for your meal plan, and created a list of items to purchase. You simply approve the purchases. It also reports small maintenance tasks it completed—oiling
          hinges, replacing lightbulbs, checking batteries, and cleaning filters.</p>

        <p>After breakfast, you request a yoga session. The yoga AI-pack installed in the butlerbot tailors a session to your body and tracks your posture for real-time correction. Then, a Spanish lesson AI-pack follows. The butlerbot simulates realistic dialogue and gives corrections, helping you build
          conversational fluency.</p>

        <p>Later, you shower in a bathroom already reset and cleaned. You start your remote workday while your butlerbot delivers tea and snacks at pre-set times.</p>

        <p>Midday, a pipe bursts. The robot hears the unusual sound and finds flooding. It shuts off the home’s main valve, notifies you via a non urgent message, and contacts a pre-approved remote plumber. While waiting, it dries the floor.</p>
        <p>The plumber logs in, reviews sensor footage, and takes manual control of the robot for inspection. He diagnoses the problem and provides a list of parts, which the butlerbot orders from a preferred vendor. Once they arrive, the plumber finishes the repair remotely. A note is left recommending future pipe
          replacements, and the full incident is logged and sent to you.</p>

        <p>After work, your robot informs you that you might be sick. It notices your high body temperature (via it's infrared vision) and droopy eyes. You realize you do feel low energy, and after a short conversation about symptons with your butlerbot, it recommends over-the-counter cold medicine.</p>

        <p>Realizing you are overdue for a checkup anyway, you ask the robot to schedule a human doctor. Your preferred doctor is only available in a few days, so you opt for a foreign doctor available in ten minutes.</p>

        <p>The doctor remotes into your butlerbot, reviews its logs, and after some research, asks if you ate a recalled herb—possibly contaminated with salmonella in your region. You confirm, and food poisoning becomes the new likely diagnosis.</p>

        <p>You ask if a blood test is still valid despite the illness. The doctor agrees and requests the robot’s model info to ensure it can perform a blood draw. Fortunately, your butlerbot is qualified.</p>

        <p>You instruct the robot to retrieve a syringe and vial from your cabinet. In this future, homes are stocked with a variety of tools that only the robot knows how to use.</p>

        <p>The doctor controls the robot to draw your blood, stores the sample, and orders a refrigerated courier robot to retrieve it. He also recommends treatment for food poisoning.</p>

        <p>Late that night, the delivery robot arrives. Your butlerbot silently hands over the vial while you sleep. All actions are logged for your optional review the next morning.</p>


        <p>In essence, in a positive and well-managed future, robots will make life easier and more convenient. They will take over repetitive and time-consuming tasks, freeing up human time for health, relationships, and meaningful work.</p>

        <p>Popular media often leans toward dystopian portrayals—robots trying to kill humans, AIs becoming self-aware and turning against their creators, or apocalyptic futures driven by technology. These scenarios make for compelling drama, but they are not the most realistic outcomes of current trends.</p>

        <p>For a more grounded and optimistic portrayal, the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1990314" target="_blank">Robot & Frank</a> is a valuable reference. It tells the story of a robot butler assigned to assist an elderly man, showing how robots might be integrated into daily life to improve
          well-being and independence without turning into a threat.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics will continue to converge, enabling R&AIs to take over most repetitive and derivative tasks. This transformation will lead to what may be remembered as the Great Automation—a period where the majority of existing jobs are either partially or fully
          automated.</p>

        <p>How society responds will determine the outcome. A poor response will bring about massive unemployment, underemployment, and widespread social disruption. A good response, on the other hand, can lead to a future where robots improve quality of life and new types of work emerge:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Blue-collar workers</strong> will become <em>remoters</em>, monitoring and controlling robots from afar, stepping in when problems arise.</li>
          <li><strong>White-collar workers</strong> will become <em>researchers</em>, producing new knowledge, inventions, and creative works. These will be packaged into modular <em>AI-packs</em> and sold in app store-style marketplaces, where R&AIs will integrate and replicate them across society.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, for this good future to be realized, it is essential to abolish the patent system. Patents have become a bottleneck to innovation and job creation for a variety of reasons, including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>They allow powerful companies to use AI to preemptively patent every imaginable invention, locking SMEs out of entire markets.</li>
          <li>They let companies shelve disruptive innovations to protect monopolies, rather than deploying them to create value and jobs.</li>
          <li>They give corporations with large legal teams the ability to intimidate and bankrupt competitors through litigation around the subjective scope of patents.</li>
          <li>They slow the pace of innovation, allowing automation to outpace the creation of new jobs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We already have the tools and knowledge required to build a prosperous future. The challenge is to use them wisely and restructure the rules of the game so that innovation benefits everyone, not just the powerful few.</p>
