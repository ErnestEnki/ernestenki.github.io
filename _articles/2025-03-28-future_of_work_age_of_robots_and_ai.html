      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Anyone paying attention to current events has reason to worry about the future of work. Artificial intelligence is replacing tasks once done by humans, and robots are steadily taking over factories. If these trends continue, key questions emerge:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Will there be enough jobs for everyone?</li>
          <li>What will future jobs look like?</li>
          <li>How can individuals and societies prepare?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This discussion builds on a section of my earlier book, <a href="/books/patent_dystopia/summary.html" target="_blank">Patent Dystopia</a>, which examined the past, present, and future of AI and robotics.</p>

        <p>Disclaimer: we will assume that technology continues progressing at its current pace, but that fully sentient AI remains either far off or impossible for reasons not yet understood. If true general AI ever arrives, all bets are off.</p>

      <h1>The Rise of R&AIs: Robots and AIs</h1>

      <div>
        <p>The future is already here—it is just not evenly distributed. Let us explore how key forces already shaping a few corners of industry will soon spread across most sectors and into everyday life.</p>

        <h2>Faster Feedback Loops</h2>
        <div>
          <p>AI is advancing faster than robotics because its feedback loop is much shorter. An AI model can train and be evaluated millions of times per second using automated systems—like another AI or hard-coded evaluators—in a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network"
              target="_blank">Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</a>. This happens in highly parallelized computing environments, allowing rapid improvement.</p>

          <p>Robots, by contrast, face a slow, physical feedback loop. Training a chef robot to fry an egg, for example, means actually frying an egg—a process that takes minutes. Some evaluation can be automated using AI vision to spot undercooked or burnt results, but final assessment often requires a human, adding
            delays.</p>

          <p>However that gap is shrinking. Robots are increasingly trained in fast, physics-based virtual simulations. These “rehearsals” allow embedded AIs to iterate quickly, like the “paint the fence” drills in The Karate Kid. Once an AI performs well in simulation, it can transfer its skills to the real
            world—already several steps ahead.</p>
        </div>

`
        <h2>Remotely Operated Robots</h2>
        <div>
          <p>A major trend that often escapes public attention is the rise of remotely operated—or teleoperated—robots.</p>
          <p>This shift has been unfolding quietly within industry, largely outside the view of everyday life. A prime example is Rio Tinto’s mining operations, where robots are controlled remotely to handle heavy machinery, transport materials, and navigate hazardous environments:</p>

          <div>
            <iframe width="880" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgeHOZHkAOU" frameborder="0" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>

          <p>But robots are not just limited to industrial settings. They are beginning to enter everyday life as well. One of the most striking examples is the Optimus robot, which has been remotely operated to work as a bartender—serving drinks, interacting with customers, and performing tasks typically handled by
            human staff. Note: At first, these robots were marketed as AI-driven. However, it was later clarified by Optimus that they were largely controlled through remote operation:</p>
          <div>
            <iframe width="600" height="701" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/agrfdLcE8qc" frameborder="0" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>

          <p>This development will initially benefit workers. For example, miners will be able to operate robots from a safe, comfortable location—far from the dangerous conditions of mining sites, which include cave-ins, inhalation of hazardous particles, and extreme heat.</p>

          <p>Even in less hazardous jobs, remote operation will be a net positive. A high-end bartender in New York City, for instance, would no longer need to live in an expensive apartment or endure long commutes. Instead, they could live in a spacious home near family in a much more affordable region and work from there—using a VR headset, haptic gloves, and other remote control tools to operate a humanoid robot behind the bar.</p>

          <p>In the early stages, these robots will be controlled by the same professionals who once performed those jobs in person. Their experience will make them well-suited to guide the robots as the technology matures.</p>

          <p>In the second phase, companies will begin to ask a simple question: if robots can be teleoperated from anywhere, why continue paying high wages to local workers?</p>
          <p>This realization will trigger a new wave of offshoring. Roles such as cooks, cleaners, construction workers, elderly caregivers, and factory operators will increasingly be filled by robots operated remotely from lower-wage regions—most likely in the developing world.</p>

          <p>Alongside this, companies will notice another opportunity. Since every teleoperated interaction can be fully recorded—using cameras, motion sensors, and other data streams—they can capture both the environment and the human response in precise detail. These massive datasets will then be used to train AI systems in virtual simulations, allowing them to gradually learn and mimic human performance.</p>

          <p>In the third phase, AI will begin taking over more and more tasks from human teleoperators. These systems will have learned from observing many human interactions and can begin automating the most repetitive and predictable parts of the job. This marks the real convergence of robotics and artificial intelligence—what we can call the era of R&AI.</p>

          <p>Given the widespread presence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">Paretto Principle</a> in the world, it is reasonable to expect that R&AI systems will eventually be able to perform around 80% of the tasks in most jobs. However, the remaining 20%—the edge cases—will still require human intervention. These are unusual or complex scenarios that machines cannot yet handle. While full automation of even these outliers is theoretically possible, it will take significantly more time and effort.</p>

          <p>The result is the emergence of a new type of job: the <b>"remoter"</b>. This is a human operator who supervises and manages multiple R&AIs, potentially in a variety of robot body types. Much like a senior employee oversees junior staff, a remoter watches over fleets of robots, intervening only when necessary.</p>

          <p>Take the restaurant industry as an example. A single human chef may monitor a network of robot cooks across several kitchens. The remoter can pause any robot, take over control, or override decisions. If an uncontrolled flame is detected, the human can take over and operate the fire extinguisher. If water stops running, the remoter can investigate the building’s water system or call the utility company.</p>

          <p>R&AI systems will also be programmed to ask for help when needed. If a robot encounters a situation it was not trained for—like opening multiple rotten eggs—it will pause and request human support. The remoter will receive a queue of such intervention requests. When it is that robot’s turn, the human might take control, inspect the remaining eggs, dispose of the spoiled ones, check the refrigeration system, and then return the robot to normal automated operation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Great Automation</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Faster feedback loops in AI are enabling machines to take over many white-collar tasks. At the same time, robots—once limited by slow physical learning—are improving rapidly. Simulated environments now allow them to practice and learn much faster. Combined with the growing use of teleoperation, R&AIs (Robots + AIs) are becoming capable of replacing blue-collar work as well.</p>
          <p>Together, these forces point to a historic shift that future generations may call The Great Automation—a period when most jobs are either partially or completely automated, with far fewer workers needed to do the same work as before.</p>
          <p>If society fails to prepare, the result could be massive unemployment or underemployment. Governments and voters may panic and respond with ineffective or harmful policies: trade wars, military aggression, scapegoating immigrants, or even the rise of extremist ideologies and hyper-religious movements. History suggests that when people feel economically powerless, they search for answers in all the wrong places.</p>
          <p>There is a better path forward. One of the most important steps governments can take is to abolish the patent system, as <a href="/books/patent_dystopia/summary.html">I discussed in my book</a>. Patents have become a major obstacle to job creation. They block small and mid-sized companies from competing and prevent useful innovation from reaching the market. In a time when automation is destroying jobs faster than ever, we must remove the barriers that block the creation of new jobs and industries.</p>
          <p>We need more competition and innovation to create entirely new kinds of jobs—ones that can replace those lost to automation</p>            
        </div>

        <h2>Jobs of the Future: Remoters and Researchers</h2>
        <div>
          <p>In the future, most jobs will fall into two broad categories: remoters and researchers. As R&AIs take over repetitive and derivative tasks, only the most complex and creative responsibilities will remain in human hands.</p>

          <p>For blue-collar workers, this shift means becoming remoters—people who monitor and occasionally take control of robotic systems when something goes wrong. They will step in to perform difficult tasks that the R&AI cannot yet handle, then return the system to automated mode.</p>

          <p>For white-collar workers, the future lies in research. Their job will be to <b>create new knowledge, inventions, original content, or art—work</b> that cannot be easily automated. These outputs will be bundled into modular “AI-packs,” which can be sold in a marketplace similar to an app store.          </p>

          <p>Owners of R&AIs will purchase these AI-packs, integrate them into their knowledge and skills, and replicate the results across society. Each AI-pack might also include instructions or links to human remoters who can assist with tasks that remain too complex or unpredictable for automation.</p>
          
          <p>AI-packs will be sold as one-time purchases or via subscriptions that offer ongoing updates. This model will allow researchers to earn predictable income while R&AIs continue expanding the reach of their ideas.</p>

          <p>This new division of labor—remoters solving edge-case problems and researchers pushing the boundaries of innovation—will define the structure of work in the age of advanced automation.</p>          

          <p>The researchers of the future will build specialized solutions that R&AIs can replicate at scale. Examples could include:</p>


          <ul>
            <li>Wind turbines optimized for low-wind regions</li>
            <li>Language learning methods tailored to personality types</li>
            <li>Eldercare plans combining mobility, diabetes, and memory support</li>
            <li>Therapy frameworks adapted to specific cultures</li>
            <li>Agricultural systems for rooftops or arid climates</li>
            <li>New artistic styles for robotic painters and photographers portray their owners important moments.</li>
            <li>Producing custom prosthetics for rare anatomical conditions</li>
            <li>Educational strategies for children with dual diagnoses (e.g., autism and dyslexia)</li>
            <li>Materials that biodegrade under specific environmental conditions</li>
            <li>Diet plans for rare metabolic disorders</li>
            <li>Robots trained in sign language or eye-tracking for caregiving tasks</li>
          </ul>

          <p>One thing that both of these future job categories—<strong>remoter</strong> and <strong>researcher</strong>—will have in common is the disappearance of entry-level roles. Traditional junior positions will be absorbed by R&AIs, which can handle routine and repetitive tasks more efficiently than humans. As a result, most available jobs will require a senior level of expertise and mastery within a specific domain.</p>

          <p>Fortunately, R&AIs will not only replace junior roles but also serve as powerful tools to help individuals <strong>accelerate</strong> their learning. These systems can teach concepts, generate practice material, evaluate understanding, and adaptively guide learners—functioning as personal teachers. This will empower individuals to achieve senior-level competence faster than ever before.</p>

          <p>However, this new work environment will present psychological and interpersonal challenges, especially for researchers. They will find themselves surrounded by R&AIs in three distinct roles:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Above:</strong> R&AIs will act as <strong>teachers</strong>, offering structured lessons, correcting mistakes, and delivering feedback. This will require individuals to remain humble and open to guidance—even from a machine.</li>
            <li><strong>Alongside:</strong> R&AIs will serve as <strong>collaborators</strong>, helping with research, running simulations, analyzing data, and providing strategic suggestions. Success here will require strong communication, coordination, and leadership skills—treating AIs as integral parts of a research team.</li>
            <li><strong>Below:</strong> R&AIs will function as <strong>subordinates</strong>, executors of instructions, following human-created plans or being temporarily controlled by remoters. Researchers will need to break down knowledge into clear, actionable steps, using their managerial and instructional abilities to effectively direct automated agents.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>


        <h2>A Typical Day in the Future</h2>
        <div>
          <p>These forces will create a future that feels like paradise for those with reasonably well-paying jobs, due to factors like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>As R&AIs reduce labor costs—often the largest expense for companies—the price of goods and services will drop significantly.</li>
            <li>Even homes will have access to humanoid robots, or <strong>butlerbots</strong>, capable of handling most household tasks.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Let's imagine how a typical day in this future might look like:</p>

          <p>You wake up to the smell of freshly baked bread and coffee—part of your meal plan that you scheduled your butlerbot to prepare. It synced the preparation with your alarm, so breakfast is hot and ready.</p>

          <p>Walking to the kitchen, you see the home already cared for: vacuumed, dusted, mopped, and tidied. Garbage has been sorted, laundry done, your cat’s litter box is clean, and its food bowl is full. Your butlerbot silently passes you to tidy your bedroom—just as you programmed it.</p>

          <p>As you eat breakfast, you check the butlerbot nightly report. The robot scanned the home for issues like leaks or faulty wiring, monitored inventory for your meal plan, and created a list of items to purchase. You simply approve the purchases. It also reports small maintenance tasks it completed—oiling hinges, replacing lightbulbs, checking batteries, and cleaning filters.</p>

          <p>After breakfast, you request a yoga session. The yoga AI-pack installed in the butlerbot tailors a session to your body and tracks your posture for real-time correction. Then, a Spanish lesson AI-pack follows. The butlerbot simulates realistic dialogue and gives corrections, helping you build conversational fluency.</p>

          <p>Later, you shower in a bathroom already reset and cleaned. You start your remote workday while your butlerbot delivers tea and snacks at pre-set times.</p>

          <p>Midday, a pipe bursts. The robot hears the unusual sound and finds flooding. It shuts off the home’s main valve, notifies you via a non urgent message, and contacts a pre-approved remote plumber. While waiting, it dries the floor.</p>
          <p>The plumber logs in, reviews sensor footage, and takes manual control of the robot for inspection. He diagnoses the problem and provides a list of parts, which the butlerbot orders from a preferred vendor. Once they arrive, the plumber finishes the repair remotely. A note is left recommending future pipe replacements, and the full incident is logged and sent to you.</p>

          <p>After work, your robot informs you that you might be sick. It notices your high body temperature (via it's infrared vision) and droopy eyes. You realize you do feel low energy, and after a short conversation about symptons with your butlerbot,  it recommends over-the-counter cold medicine.</p>

          <p>Realizing you are overdue for a checkup anyway, you ask the robot to schedule a human doctor. Your preferred doctor is only available in a few days, so you opt for a foreign doctor available in ten minutes.</p>

          <p>The doctor remotes into your butlerbot, reviews its logs, and after some research, asks if you ate a recalled herb—possibly contaminated with salmonella in your region. You confirm, and food poisoning becomes the new likely diagnosis.</p>

          <p>You ask if a blood test is still valid despite the illness. The doctor agrees and requests the robot’s model info to ensure it can perform a blood draw. Fortunately, your butlerbot is qualified.</p>

          <p>You instruct the robot to retrieve a syringe and vial from your cabinet. In this future, homes are stocked with a variety of tools that only the robot knows how to use.</p>

          <p>The doctor controls the robot to draw your blood, stores the sample, and orders a refrigerated courier robot to retrieve it. He also recommends treatment for food poisoning.</p>

          <p>Late that night, the delivery robot arrives. Your butlerbot silently hands over the vial while you sleep. All actions are logged for your optional review the next morning.</p>


          <p>In essence, in a positive and well-managed future, robots will make life easier and more convenient. They will take over repetitive and time-consuming tasks, freeing up human time for health, relationships, and meaningful work.</p>

          <p>Popular media often leans toward dystopian portrayals—robots trying to kill humans, AIs becoming self-aware and turning against their creators, or apocalyptic futures driven by technology. These scenarios make for compelling drama, but they are not the most realistic outcomes of current trends.</p>

          <p>For a more grounded and optimistic portrayal, the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1990314" target="_blank">Robot & Frank</a> is a valuable reference. It tells the story of a robot butler assigned to assist an elderly man, showing how robots might be integrated into daily life to improve well-being and independence without turning into a threat.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <div>
        <p>Advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics will continue to converge, enabling R&AIs to take over most repetitive and derivative tasks. This transformation will lead to what may be remembered as the Great Automation—a period where the majority of existing jobs are either partially or fully automated.</p>

        <p>How society responds will determine the outcome. A poor response will bring about massive unemployment, underemployment, and widespread social disruption. A good response, on the other hand, can lead to a future where robots improve quality of life and new types of work emerge:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Blue-collar workers</strong> will become <em>remoters</em>, monitoring and controlling robots from afar, stepping in when problems arise.</li>
          <li><strong>White-collar workers</strong> will become <em>researchers</em>, producing new knowledge, inventions, and creative works. These will be packaged into modular <em>AI-packs</em> and sold in app store-style marketplaces, where R&AIs will integrate and replicate them across society.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, for this good future to be realized, it is essential to abolish the patent system. Patents have become a bottleneck to innovation and job creation for a variety of reasons, including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>They allow powerful companies to use AI to preemptively patent every imaginable invention, locking SMEs out of entire markets.</li>
          <li>They let companies shelve disruptive innovations to protect monopolies, rather than deploying them to create value and jobs.</li>
          <li>They give corporations with large legal teams the ability to intimidate and bankrupt competitors through litigation around the subjective scope of patents.</li>
          <li>They slow the pace of innovation, allowing automation to outpace the creation of new jobs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We already have the tools and knowledge required to build a prosperous future. The challenge is to use them wisely and restructure the rules of the game so that innovation benefits everyone, not just the powerful few.</p>
