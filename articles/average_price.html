    <article>
      <p>Fungible assets such as stocks, ETFs, indexes, options, derivatives, commodities, currencies, cryptocurrencies
        and their tokens, and bonds are
        almost always evaluated by their last traded price. We see this approach everywhere: in news reports, academic
        papers, and on financial systems. Yet we seldom ask whether the last traded price is truly the best measure for
        every situation. Could relying on it be misleading when it is applied to the wrong problems?</p>
      <p>Consider a simple example: imagine a stock trading at a steady price of 100 dollars throughout the day, with a
        total volume of one billion shares. Then, on the very last trade of the day, a mere one thousand shares change
        hands at 40 dollars. Market reports would claim a 60 percent drop in the stock (from 100 to 40), even though
        that final trade did not reflect the broader activity, and the market itself had barely moved.
      </p>

      <p>Relying on last traded price as the "representative" price can create several problems:</p>


      <h2>Last Traded Price Overuse Causes Investor Overreactions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Amplifies Short-Term Noise:</b>
          <p>Many investors, especially retail traders, react emotionally to price movements. Treating short-term
            fluctuations as if they are meaningful trends can trigger impulsive decisions.</p>
          <p><b>Example:</b> A stock closes at 100 dollars, then a single investor buys just one share at 105
            dollars. This minor purchase can suggest a sudden “5 percent increase,” even though there was almost no
            volume supporting it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Misleading After-Hours Price Gaps:</b>
          <p>During after-market and pre-market hours, trading volume is usually low, so small trades can create
            large shifts.</p>
          <p><b>Example:</b> A stock that closes at 50 dollars might see a final after-hours trade at 40 dollars.
            With so few shares trading hands, the plunge is not truly representative of the market’s view, yet it
            might alarm investors.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Last Traded Price is an Unstable Foundation</h2>
      <p>The last traded price is an unstable basis for important processes such as margin calls, limit orders,
        stop-loss orders, valuations of funds, Net Asset Value (NAV) calculations, earnings reports and year-end
        financial reports.
        Since the last traded price can be volatile, manipulated, or out of sync with the broader market, it can
        mislead investors, stakeholders, governments, and financial institutions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Stop-Loss Triggers from Low-Volume Trades:</b>
          <p>A small, low-volume trade below an investor’s stop-loss threshold may trigger an unwanted sale, even
            though the broader market still values the asset above that level.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>End-of-Year Valuation Distortions:</b>
          <p>Near fiscal year-end, a brief dip in an asset’s price can reduce a company’s or fund’s official
            valuation. This can lead to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Skewed Financial Statements:</b> Firms appear less valuable than they truly are.</li>
            <li><b>Incorrect Taxation:</b> Investors and corporations may pay the wrong capital gains taxes.</li>
            <li><b>Investor Misperception:</b> Funds pegged to NAV seem weaker due to last-minute pricing anomalies.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Last Traded Price Overuse Increases Market Volatility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Self-Fulfilling Price Swings:</b>
          <p>Because many trading tools—margin calls, limit orders, and stop-loss orders—react to the last traded
            price, rapid shifts in that price can trigger chain reactions.</p>
          <p><b>Example:</b> If a temporary drop activates countless automated sell orders, it can spark a cycle of
            additional price drops, known as cascading liquidations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Flash Crashes and Panic Selling:</b>
          <p>Some flash crashes happen when algorithmic trading and limit orders respond to short-lived price dips.
          </p>
          <p><b>Example:</b> In the 2010 Flash Crash, high-frequency trading and triggered stop-loss orders caused
            the Dow Jones to lose about 9 percent in minutes before quickly recovering.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Last Traded Price Overuse Makes Markets Easy to Manipulate</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>"Painting the Tape":</b>
          <p>A trader or institution can place several small orders at misleading prices to make an asset look
            stronger or weaker than it is.</p>
          <p><b>Example:</b> A trader who wants to boost a stock’s price before an earnings report might buy tiny
            batches of shares at slightly higher prices to imitate strong demand.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Marking the Close:</b>
          <p>Since closing prices guide institutional valuations, some entities strategically place orders near the
            market’s close to affect that final price.</p>
          <p><b>Example:</b> A hedge fund wanting to improve quarterly returns could submit a major buy order in the
            last seconds of trading, pushing the closing price higher to reflect better performance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Manipulating Stock Options and Derivatives:</b>
          <p>Options often settle based on the last traded price. A trader who holds many option contracts can push
            the final price to gain a profitable outcome.</p>
          <p><b>Example:</b> An investor holding several 50-dollar call options might buy shares aggressively near
            the close, driving the price above 50 dollars so that the calls expire in the money.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Currently, most stock exchanges around the world give the public free access only to the last traded
        price during market hours, along with daily data after the market closes, where closing price is again, the last
        traded price, for example:</p>

      <img src="img/exchanges_current_data.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block " />

      <p>In many cases, the way this information is reported has stayed the same for decades, despite the creation of
        new technologies that could provide more and better data. Meanwhile, modern financial tools—such as margin calls
        and limit orders—have appeared and often misuse these outdated reporting methods, which can lead to serious
        market upheavals.</p>

      <h2>Solution: Average Price</h2>
      <p>A more sensible default market indicator for most situations is the <b>Average Price</b>, with volume weighting as the only rational approach, therefore it is implied. This indicator is 
        known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume-weighted_average_price" target="_blank">Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)</a>, widely used in technical trading, often calculated daily, but it can be applied to any timeframe.
      </p>

      <p>or simplicity, memorability, and strong marketing, we will refer to VWAP simply as Average Price.</p>

      <p>Although we learned how to calculate weighted averages in
        primary school, we seem to have forgotten to use that skill where it matters most. Let us now calculate it for the earlier example involving the misrepresented asset:</p>

      <div>
        <math>
          <mfrac>
            <mrow>
              <mo>(</mo>
              <mn>$100</mn>
              <mo>×</mo>
              <mn>1 000 000 000</mn>
              <mo>)</mo>
              <mo>+</mo>
              <mo>(</mo>
              <mn>$40</mn>
              <mo>×</mo>
              <mn>1 000</mn>
              <mo>)</mo>
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              <mn>1 000 000 000</mn>
              <mo>+</mo>
              <mn>1 000</mn>
            </mrow>
          </mfrac>
          <mo>=</mo>
          <mn>$99.99994 Average Price</mn>
        </math>
      </div>

      <p>Reporting the Average Price (or rounding it to 100 dollars) is the most reliable default price to show the public and to
        use in charts and analyses. It would have made clear that there was no crash and very little volatility. This
        does not mean the last traded price has no value—it might matter if you plan to trade right away. However,
        considering last traded price together with a
        short-term Average Price, such as one calculated over the past ten minutes or one hour, could be a better decision-making
        strategy.</p>

      <p>Most stock exchanges do not provide Average Price data to the public, either through free information packages or paid
        data services. As a result, many companies calculate Average Price on their own by subscribing to feeds that reveal every
        executed trade, which can be expensive. Some financial data providers, such as Bloomberg and Refinitiv, include
        Average Price as part of their premium offerings.</p>

      <p>However technologies for streaming data, such as <a href="https://spark.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache
          Spark</a>, which many exchanges likely already use in one form or another, make it simple and cost-effective
        to calculate Average Price in real time as trades take place. Calculations can even be grouped into time intervals for
        more specific analysis..</p>

      <p>There is no need to recalculate Average Price using every past trade each time a new transaction occurs. Instead, you
        can maintain two running totals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Cumulative Traded Value:</b> The sum of (price × volume) for each trade.</li>
        <li><b>Cumulative Volume:</b> The total of all traded volumes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When a new trade comes in, you can update Average Price with a quick calculation that is both computationally and
        financially inexpensive:</p>
      <div>
        <math>
          <mn>new Average Price</mn>
          <mo>=</mo>
          <mfrac>
            <mrow>
              <mn>Cumulative Traded Value</mn>
              <mo>+</mo>
              <mo>(</mo>
              <mn>New Price</mn>
              <mo>×</mo>
              <mn>New Volume</mn>
              <mo>)</mo>
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              <mn>Cumulative Volume</mn>
              <mo>+</mo>
              <mn>New Volume</mn>
            </mrow>
          </mfrac>
        </math>
      </div>

      <p>In essence, new financial reporting standards are needed to address modern financial risks and to take
        advantage of new technological possibilities. Consider the following points:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The last traded price is frequently misused by the media, the general public, and financial markets, leading
          to overreactions and market volatility.</li>
        <li>This misuse creates opportunities for manipulation and undermines trust in markets.</li>
        <li>Reporting requirements have not evolved, even though technology and financial tools have advanced and
          created fresh needs and possibilities.</li>
        <li>Providing more detailed or alternative statistics is now inexpensive and computationally straightforward.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We propose a new regulation or law that requires all publicly traded assets to disclose fresh data to the
        public, at no cost, in a format easily accessible to both people and machines. This data would include, for each
        minute in the last two hours of trading, and updated every minute, an aggregated summary that provides the
        following data points (as a made up of example of a volatile asset):</p>

      <p>1: This data reflects the most recent two hours of active trading time, not the last two hours by the
        clock. For example, if an exchange closes for the weekend, then in the first 15 minutes of trading on Monday, we
        would only see data for those 15 minutes. The following 105 minutes would represent the final part of Friday’s
        trading.</p>
      <p>2: Another key detail is that if no trades occur during a particular minute, that minute must still be listed.
        The relevant columns would show “N/A,” while Traded Value, Volume, and Number of Trades would be recorded as
        zero. This information highlights low liquidity or possible market uncertainty.</p>

      <p>This style of reporting may appear quirky or unnatural at first. Why record data by the minute, and only for
        the last two hours? The reason is that modern systems can easily capture and store this information almost
        instantly, and two hours provides a suitable margin of safety for most purposes. One-minute intervals allow
        anyone to combine the data into any timeframe they prefer—such as ten minutes, one day, a week, a month, or even
        a year.</p>

      <p>The first columns are already reported in daily summaries, the only new thing is that we will also have reporting per minute. The columns in yellow are new, not currently reported to the public, and the column in green would not be provided, but calculated on the fly by consumers, we only put it Thereas
        as an example of how the Average Price can display drastically different information about the state of the market than any other column available before
      </p>
      <p><b>Traded Value</b>, alongside the
        existing <b>Volume</b>, gives analysts the ingredients to calculate the Volume-Weighted Average Price for
        any
        timeframe, as well as other metrics like moving averages. The <b>Number of Trades</b> shows how many individual
        trades
        took place within each minute; a higher number of trades at varying price points can indicate a healthier market
        compared to single, large trades that skew the price. By dividing <b>Traded Value</b> by the <b>Number of
          Trades</b>, you can
        find the Average Trade Size, which helps detect whether a few large trades might be distorting the Average Price.
      </p>

      <p>Undoubtedly, market participants will develop many more useful indicators from this data in the future</p>

      <p>Gathering and storing this data from exchanges is inexpensive, and it empowers all market participants—big or
        small—to make more informed decisions.</p>

      <p>Regulators may consider requiring additional indicators, such as Algorithmic Trading Activity, the Average
        Spread During Each Minute, the Number of Unique Buyers and Sellers, or Order Book Imbalance (the ratio of buy
        volume to sell volume). However, we have not recommended these here, because their inclusion would demand more
        detailed analysis and requirements to ensure that they are not prone to manipulation or overly complex and
        costly to calculate. Perhaps the best approach would be pass two changes, one with the easy changes suggested in
        this page, and another one with further improvements.</p>

      <p>Replacing the last traded price with Average Price and other indicators can help serve different goals. For example, a
        more sophisticated limit order could execute only if the last 10-minute Average Price drops below a certain value, and
        the volume in that same period remains consistent with the daily average. This shift moves us away from
        black-and-white thinking and toward a more nuanced approach, asking: “Which price measure is most representative
        for this particular situation?”</p>

      <h2>Avoiding central planning</h2>

      <p>We should avoid the urge to centrally plan industries or societies because it usually leads to more errors than truly informed decisions. Nobody should be forced to use the new data available. The media can continue focusing on last traded prices if they choose, and financial firms can still rely on them for margin calls, options, trade limits, and other automated processes.</p>
      <p>However, over time, most participants will likely adopt new indicators such as Average Price, benefiting everyone involved.</p>

      <p>Mandating that exchanges publish new data is within the government’s role of enhancing transparency by giving people better information for decision-making. This approach contrasts with creating laws and rules to micromanage markets.</p>


      <h2>Are There Any Downsides?</h2>
      <p>While Average Price is more robust, it isn’t perfect, however there are possible steps to remediate its weaknesses:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Not Ideal for Real-Time Trading Decisions: In fast-moving markets, traders might need the last traded
          price
          for immediate decision-making.</li>
        <li>Fear of Misinterpretation: If retail traders don’t understand Average Price well, they might over-rely on it
          without
          considering bid-ask spreads or real liquidity depth.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Possible remediation: traders to use last traded price, high and lows, or even calculate their own Average Price for
        a
        shorter period (like the last few hours) using live data feeds, to better enlighten their decisions.
        Education
        on what indicators (or more likely, combination of indicators) to use for each situation can also help.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Average Price Distortion in Very Illiquid Markets: If a market has huge gaps between trades, Average Price may still be
          misleading if based on limited data.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Possible remediation: trading interfaces to display a Average Price reliability score (such as red, yellow and
        green),
        based on the associated volume or total trades or other indicators.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Revenue Model Considerations: Some exchanges sell detailed market data to institutions for high fees.
          They
          might not want to give away valuable insights for free.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Possible remediation: Pointing out that this new data will increase the credibility and transparency of the
        market, by reducing undue volatility and making it harder to manipulate, and the costs to implement are
        relatively low with modern technology. More importantly, when the market reaches new levels of confidence
        once
        their learn to use these
        new data points for the right problems, there could be an opportunity to expand the market for publicly
        traded
        assets. At the moment, only big companies can trade their stocks there, in part because liquidity is
        necessary, but
        there could be separate section of the market for medium sized companies to trade, because now the public
        has better tools to manage low liquidity.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Added uncertainty and options: most of society has standardized around using Last Traded Price (for good or for bad), using Average Price is not only a change that might be disruptive, but its also not black and white, each situation might call for different time frames for the Average Price (like 10min, 30min, 1 day, 3 days).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Possible remediation: Highligthing that using Average Price is optional at first, and as different use cases move to Average Price, the mover can provide education around why and how it will work. For example, if a trading company reconfigures their margin call mechanisms to use 30min Average Price instead of Last Traded Prices, they can explain why this timeframe was chosen.
        Goverments tax rules (in the rare cases where they tax unrealized gains), can specify that the indicator chosen was the last 30 days of the Financial Year for example, and why this choice was made.
        Choosing the right time frames is indeed extra work, but it is necessary and useful work to make the markets more transparent and resilent. Backtesting can be used to simulate the effects of different time frames on different mechanisms.
      </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Using the Last Traded Price as the main indicator of the market state in most situations is a mistake. It encourages investor overreactions, increases market volatility, and makes the market easier to manipulate.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the Average Price is a more transparent, sophisticated, flexible and composable (we can build on top of it) indicator. It serves as a better foundation for developing improved financial and technological tools in the future. A key example of such a tool will be presented in a future article.
